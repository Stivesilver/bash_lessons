    74	CHAPTER I
    75	
    76	
    77	I scarcely know where to begin, though I sometimes facetiously place the
    78	cause of it all to Charley Furuseth’s credit.  He kept a summer cottage
    79	in Mill Valley, under the shadow of Mount Tamalpais, and never occupied
    80	it except when he loafed through the winter months and read Nietzsche and
    81	Schopenhauer to rest his brain.  When summer came on, he elected to sweat
    82	out a hot and dusty existence in the city and to toil incessantly.  Had
    83	it not been my custom to run up to see him every Saturday afternoon and
    84	to stop over till Monday morning, this particular January Monday morning
    85	would not have found me afloat on San Francisco Bay.
    86	
    87	Not but that I was afloat in a safe craft, for the _Martinez_ was a new
    88	ferry-steamer, making her fourth or fifth trip on the run between
    89	Sausalito and San Francisco.  The danger lay in the heavy fog which
    90	blanketed the bay, and of which, as a landsman, I had little
    91	apprehension.  In fact, I remember the placid exaltation with which I
    92	took up my position on the forward upper deck, directly beneath the
    93	pilot-house, and allowed the mystery of the fog to lay hold of my
    94	imagination.  A fresh breeze was blowing, and for a time I was alone in
    95	the moist obscurity—yet not alone, for I was dimly conscious of the
    96	presence of the pilot, and of what I took to be the captain, in the glass
    97	house above my head.
    98	
    99	I remember thinking how comfortable it was, this division of labour which
   100	made it unnecessary for me to study fogs, winds, tides, and navigation,
   101	in order to visit my friend who lived across an arm of the sea.  It was
   102	good that men should be specialists, I mused.  The peculiar knowledge of
   103	the pilot and captain sufficed for many thousands of people who knew no
   104	more of the sea and navigation than I knew.  On the other hand, instead
   105	of having to devote my energy to the learning of a multitude of things, I
   106	concentrated it upon a few particular things, such as, for instance, the
   107	analysis of Poe’s place in American literature—an essay of mine, by the
   108	way, in the current _Atlantic_.  Coming aboard, as I passed through the
   109	cabin, I had noticed with greedy eyes a stout gentleman reading the
   110	_Atlantic_, which was open at my very essay.  And there it was again, the
   111	division of labour, the special knowledge of the pilot and captain which
   112	permitted the stout gentleman to read my special knowledge on Poe while
   113	they carried him safely from Sausalito to San Francisco.
   114	
   115	A red-faced man, slamming the cabin door behind him and stumping out on
   116	the deck, interrupted my reflections, though I made a mental note of the
   117	topic for use in a projected essay which I had thought of calling “The
   118	Necessity for Freedom: A Plea for the Artist.”  The red-faced man shot a
   119	glance up at the pilot-house, gazed around at the fog, stumped across the
   120	deck and back (he evidently had artificial legs), and stood still by my
   121	side, legs wide apart, and with an expression of keen enjoyment on his
   122	face.  I was not wrong when I decided that his days had been spent on the
   123	sea.
   124	
   125	“It’s nasty weather like this here that turns heads grey before their
   126	time,” he said, with a nod toward the pilot-house.
   127	
   128	“I had not thought there was any particular strain,” I answered.  “It
   129	seems as simple as A, B, C.  They know the direction by compass, the
   130	distance, and the speed.  I should not call it anything more than
   131	mathematical certainty.”
   132	
   133	“Strain!” he snorted.  “Simple as A, B, C!  Mathematical certainty!”
   134	
   135	He seemed to brace himself up and lean backward against the air as he
   136	stared at me.  “How about this here tide that’s rushin’ out through the
   137	Golden Gate?” he demanded, or bellowed, rather.  “How fast is she ebbin’?
   138	What’s the drift, eh?  Listen to that, will you?  A bell-buoy, and we’re
   139	a-top of it!  See ’em alterin’ the course!”
   140	
   141	From out of the fog came the mournful tolling of a bell, and I could see
   142	the pilot turning the wheel with great rapidity.  The bell, which had
   143	seemed straight ahead, was now sounding from the side.  Our own whistle
   144	was blowing hoarsely, and from time to time the sound of other whistles
   145	came to us from out of the fog.
   146	
   147	“That’s a ferry-boat of some sort,” the new-comer said, indicating a
   148	whistle off to the right.  “And there!  D’ye hear that?  Blown by mouth.
   149	Some scow schooner, most likely.  Better watch out, Mr. Schooner-man.
   150	Ah, I thought so.  Now hell’s a poppin’ for somebody!”
   151	
   152	The unseen ferry-boat was blowing blast after blast, and the mouth-blown
   153	horn was tooting in terror-stricken fashion.
   154	
   155	“And now they’re payin’ their respects to each other and tryin’ to get
   156	clear,” the red-faced man went on, as the hurried whistling ceased.
   157	
   158	His face was shining, his eyes flashing with excitement as he translated
   159	into articulate language the speech of the horns and sirens.  “That’s a
   160	steam-siren a-goin’ it over there to the left.  And you hear that fellow
   161	with a frog in his throat—a steam schooner as near as I can judge,
   162	crawlin’ in from the Heads against the tide.”
   163	
   164	A shrill little whistle, piping as if gone mad, came from directly ahead
   165	and from very near at hand.  Gongs sounded on the _Martinez_.  Our
   166	paddle-wheels stopped, their pulsing beat died away, and then they
   167	started again.  The shrill little whistle, like the chirping of a cricket
   168	amid the cries of great beasts, shot through the fog from more to the
   169	side and swiftly grew faint and fainter.  I looked to my companion for
   170	enlightenment.
   171	
   172	“One of them dare-devil launches,” he said.  “I almost wish we’d sunk
   173	him, the little rip!  They’re the cause of more trouble.  And what good
   174	are they?  Any jackass gets aboard one and runs it from hell to
   175	breakfast, blowin’ his whistle to beat the band and tellin’ the rest of
   176	the world to look out for him, because he’s comin’ and can’t look out for
   177	himself!  Because he’s comin’!  And you’ve got to look out, too!  Right
   178	of way!  Common decency!  They don’t know the meanin’ of it!”
   179	
   180	I felt quite amused at his unwarranted choler, and while he stumped
   181	indignantly up and down I fell to dwelling upon the romance of the fog.
   182	And romantic it certainly was—the fog, like the grey shadow of infinite
   183	mystery, brooding over the whirling speck of earth; and men, mere motes
   184	of light and sparkle, cursed with an insane relish for work, riding their
   185	steeds of wood and steel through the heart of the mystery, groping their
   186	way blindly through the Unseen, and clamouring and clanging in confident
   187	speech the while their hearts are heavy with incertitude and fear.
   188	
   189	The voice of my companion brought me back to myself with a laugh.  I too
   190	had been groping and floundering, the while I thought I rode clear-eyed
   191	through the mystery.
   192	
   193	“Hello! somebody comin’ our way,” he was saying.  “And d’ye hear that?
   194	He’s comin’ fast.  Walking right along.  Guess he don’t hear us yet.
   195	Wind’s in wrong direction.”
   196	
   197	The fresh breeze was blowing right down upon us, and I could hear the
   198	whistle plainly, off to one side and a little ahead.
   199	
   200	“Ferry-boat?” I asked.
   201	
   202	He nodded, then added, “Or he wouldn’t be keepin’ up such a clip.”  He
   203	gave a short chuckle.  “They’re gettin’ anxious up there.”
   204	
   205	I glanced up.  The captain had thrust his head and shoulders out of the
   206	pilot-house, and was staring intently into the fog as though by sheer
   207	force of will he could penetrate it.  His face was anxious, as was the
   208	face of my companion, who had stumped over to the rail and was gazing
   209	with a like intentness in the direction of the invisible danger.
   210	
   211	Then everything happened, and with inconceivable rapidity.  The fog
   212	seemed to break away as though split by a wedge, and the bow of a
   213	steamboat emerged, trailing fog-wreaths on either side like seaweed on
   214	the snout of Leviathan.  I could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded
   215	man leaning partly out of it, on his elbows.  He was clad in a blue
   216	uniform, and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was.  His quietness,
   217	under the circumstances, was terrible.  He accepted Destiny, marched hand
   218	in hand with it, and coolly measured the stroke.  As he leaned there, he
   219	ran a calm and speculative eye over us, as though to determine the
   220	precise point of the collision, and took no notice whatever when our
   221	pilot, white with rage, shouted, “Now you’ve done it!”
   222	
   223	On looking back, I realize that the remark was too obvious to make
   224	rejoinder necessary.
   225	
   226	“Grab hold of something and hang on,” the red-faced man said to me.  All
   227	his bluster had gone, and he seemed to have caught the contagion of
   228	preternatural calm.  “And listen to the women scream,” he said
   229	grimly—almost bitterly, I thought, as though he had been through the
   230	experience before.
   231	
   232	The vessels came together before I could follow his advice.  We must have
   233	been struck squarely amidships, for I saw nothing, the strange steamboat
   234	having passed beyond my line of vision.  The _Martinez_ heeled over,
   235	sharply, and there was a crashing and rending of timber.  I was thrown
   236	flat on the wet deck, and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the
   237	scream of the women.  This it was, I am certain,—the most indescribable
   238	of blood-curdling sounds,—that threw me into a panic.  I remembered the
   239	life-preservers stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and swept
   240	backward by a wild rush of men and women.  What happened in the next few
   241	minutes I do not recollect, though I have a clear remembrance of pulling
   242	down life-preservers from the overhead racks, while the red-faced man
   243	fastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women.  This
   244	memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen.  It
   245	is a picture, and I can see it now,—the jagged edges of the hole in the
   246	side of the cabin, through which the grey fog swirled and eddied; the
   247	empty upholstered seats, littered with all the evidences of sudden
   248	flight, such as packages, hand satchels, umbrellas, and wraps; the stout
   249	gentleman who had been reading my essay, encased in cork and canvas, the
   250	magazine still in his hand, and asking me with monotonous insistence if I
   251	thought there was any danger; the red-faced man, stumping gallantly
   252	around on his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers;
   253	and finally, the screaming bedlam of women.
   254	
   255	This it was, the screaming of the women, that most tried my nerves.  It
   256	must have tried, too, the nerves of the red-faced man, for I have another
   257	picture which will never fade from my mind.  The stout gentleman is
   258	stuffing the magazine into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously.
   259	A tangled mass of women, with drawn, white faces and open mouths, is
   260	shrieking like a chorus of lost souls; and the red-faced man, his face
   261	now purplish with wrath, and with arms extended overhead as in the act of
   262	hurling thunderbolts, is shouting, “Shut up!  Oh, shut up!”
   263	
   264	I remember the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, and in the next
   265	instant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for these were women
   266	of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon
   267	them and unwilling to die.  And I remember that the sounds they made
   268	reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and
   269	I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy.  These women,
   270	capable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest sympathies, were
   271	open-mouthed and screaming.  They wanted to live, they were helpless,
   272	like rats in a trap, and they screamed.
   273	
   274	The horror of it drove me out on deck.  I was feeling sick and squeamish,
   275	and sat down on a bench.  In a hazy way I saw and heard men rushing and
   276	shouting as they strove to lower the boats.  It was just as I had read
   277	descriptions of such scenes in books.  The tackles jammed.  Nothing
   278	worked.  One boat lowered away with the plugs out, filled with women and
   279	children and then with water, and capsized.  Another boat had been
   280	lowered by one end, and still hung in the tackle by the other end, where
   281	it had been abandoned.  Nothing was to be seen of the strange steamboat
   282	which had caused the disaster, though I heard men saying that she would
   283	undoubtedly send boats to our assistance.
   284	
   285	I descended to the lower deck.  The _Martinez_ was sinking fast, for the
   286	water was very near.  Numbers of the passengers were leaping overboard.
   287	Others, in the water, were clamouring to be taken aboard again.  No one
   288	heeded them.  A cry arose that we were sinking.  I was seized by the
   289	consequent panic, and went over the side in a surge of bodies.  How I
   290	went over I do not know, though I did know, and instantly, why those in
   291	the water were so desirous of getting back on the steamer.  The water was
   292	cold—so cold that it was painful.  The pang, as I plunged into it, was as
   293	quick and sharp as that of fire.  It bit to the marrow.  It was like the
   294	grip of death.  I gasped with the anguish and shock of it, filling my
   295	lungs before the life-preserver popped me to the surface.  The taste of
   296	the salt was strong in my mouth, and I was strangling with the acrid
   297	stuff in my throat and lungs.
   298	
   299	But it was the cold that was most distressing.  I felt that I could
   300	survive but a few minutes.  People were struggling and floundering in the
   301	water about me.  I could hear them crying out to one another.  And I
   302	heard, also, the sound of oars.  Evidently the strange steamboat had
   303	lowered its boats.  As the time went by I marvelled that I was still
   304	alive.  I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while a chilling
   305	numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it.  Small waves,
   306	with spiteful foaming crests, continually broke over me and into my
   307	mouth, sending me off into more strangling paroxysms.
   308	
   309	The noises grew indistinct, though I heard a final and despairing chorus
   310	of screams in the distance, and knew that the _Martinez_ had gone down.
   311	Later,—how much later I have no knowledge,—I came to myself with a start
   312	of fear.  I was alone.  I could hear no calls or cries—only the sound of
   313	the waves, made weirdly hollow and reverberant by the fog.  A panic in a
   314	crowd, which partakes of a sort of community of interest, is not so
   315	terrible as a panic when one is by oneself; and such a panic I now
   316	suffered.  Whither was I drifting?  The red-faced man had said that the
   317	tide was ebbing through the Golden Gate.  Was I, then, being carried out
   318	to sea?  And the life-preserver in which I floated?  Was it not liable to
   319	go to pieces at any moment?  I had heard of such things being made of
   320	paper and hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all
   321	buoyancy.  And I could not swim a stroke.  And I was alone, floating,
   322	apparently, in the midst of a grey primordial vastness.  I confess that a
   323	madness seized me, that I shrieked aloud as the women had shrieked, and
   324	beat the water with my numb hands.
   325	
   326	How long this lasted I have no conception, for a blankness intervened, of
   327	which I remember no more than one remembers of troubled and painful
   328	sleep.  When I aroused, it was as after centuries of time; and I saw,
   329	almost above me and emerging from the fog, the bow of a vessel, and three
   330	triangular sails, each shrewdly lapping the other and filled with wind.
   331	Where the bow cut the water there was a great foaming and gurgling, and I
   332	seemed directly in its path.  I tried to cry out, but was too exhausted.
   333	The bow plunged down, just missing me and sending a swash of water clear
   334	over my head.  Then the long, black side of the vessel began slipping
   335	past, so near that I could have touched it with my hands.  I tried to
   336	reach it, in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails, but my
   337	arms were heavy and lifeless.  Again I strove to call out, but made no
   338	sound.
   339	
   340	The stern of the vessel shot by, dropping, as it did so, into a hollow
   341	between the waves; and I caught a glimpse of a man standing at the wheel,
   342	and of another man who seemed to be doing little else than smoke a cigar.
   343	I saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and
   344	glanced out over the water in my direction.  It was a careless,
   345	unpremeditated glance, one of those haphazard things men do when they
   346	have no immediate call to do anything in particular, but act because they
   347	are alive and must do something.
   348	
   349	But life and death were in that glance.  I could see the vessel being
   350	swallowed up in the fog; I saw the back of the man at the wheel, and the
   351	head of the other man turning, slowly turning, as his gaze struck the
   352	water and casually lifted along it toward me.  His face wore an absent
   353	expression, as of deep thought, and I became afraid that if his eyes did
   354	light upon me he would nevertheless not see me.  But his eyes did light
   355	upon me, and looked squarely into mine; and he did see me, for he sprang
   356	to the wheel, thrusting the other man aside, and whirled it round and
   357	round, hand over hand, at the same time shouting orders of some sort.
   358	The vessel seemed to go off at a tangent to its former course and leapt
   359	almost instantly from view into the fog.
   360	
   361	I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness, and tried with all the power
   362	of my will to fight above the suffocating blankness and darkness that was
   363	rising around me.  A little later I heard the stroke of oars, growing
   364	nearer and nearer, and the calls of a man.  When he was very near I heard
   365	him crying, in vexed fashion, “Why in hell don’t you sing out?”  This
   366	meant me, I thought, and then the blankness and darkness rose over me.
   367	
   368	
   369	
   370	
   371	CHAPTER II
   372	
   373	
   374	I seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit vastness.  Sparkling
   375	points of light spluttered and shot past me.  They were stars, I knew,
   376	and flaring comets, that peopled my flight among the suns.  As I reached
   377	the limit of my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing, a
   378	great gong struck and thundered.  For an immeasurable period, lapped in
   379	the rippling of placid centuries, I enjoyed and pondered my tremendous
   380	flight.
   381	
   382	But a change came over the face of the dream, for a dream I told myself
   383	it must be.  My rhythm grew shorter and shorter.  I was jerked from swing
   384	to counter swing with irritating haste.  I could scarcely catch my
   385	breath, so fiercely was I impelled through the heavens.  The gong
   386	thundered more frequently and more furiously.  I grew to await it with a
   387	nameless dread.  Then it seemed as though I were being dragged over
   388	rasping sands, white and hot in the sun.  This gave place to a sense of
   389	intolerable anguish.  My skin was scorching in the torment of fire.  The
   390	gong clanged and knelled.  The sparkling points of light flashed past me
   391	in an interminable stream, as though the whole sidereal system were
   392	dropping into the void.  I gasped, caught my breath painfully, and opened
   393	my eyes.  Two men were kneeling beside me, working over me.  My mighty
   394	rhythm was the lift and forward plunge of a ship on the sea.  The
   395	terrific gong was a frying-pan, hanging on the wall, that rattled and
   396	clattered with each leap of the ship.  The rasping, scorching sands were
   397	a man’s hard hands chafing my naked chest.  I squirmed under the pain of
   398	it, and half lifted my head.  My chest was raw and red, and I could see
   399	tiny blood globules starting through the torn and inflamed cuticle.
   400	
   401	“That’ll do, Yonson,” one of the men said.  “Carn’t yer see you’ve
   402	bloomin’ well rubbed all the gent’s skin orf?”
   403	
   404	The man addressed as Yonson, a man of the heavy Scandinavian type, ceased
   405	chafing me, and arose awkwardly to his feet.  The man who had spoken to
   406	him was clearly a Cockney, with the clean lines and weakly pretty, almost
   407	effeminate, face of the man who has absorbed the sound of Bow Bells with
   408	his mother’s milk.  A draggled muslin cap on his head and a dirty
   409	gunny-sack about his slim hips proclaimed him cook of the decidedly dirty
   410	ship’s galley in which I found myself.
   411	
   412	“An’ ’ow yer feelin’ now, sir?” he asked, with the subservient smirk
   413	which comes only of generations of tip-seeking ancestors.
   414	
   415	For reply, I twisted weakly into a sitting posture, and was helped by
   416	Yonson to my feet.  The rattle and bang of the frying-pan was grating
   417	horribly on my nerves.  I could not collect my thoughts.  Clutching the
   418	woodwork of the galley for support,—and I confess the grease with which
   419	it was scummed put my teeth on edge,—I reached across a hot cooking-range
   420	to the offending utensil, unhooked it, and wedged it securely into the
   421	coal-box.
   422	
   423	The cook grinned at my exhibition of nerves, and thrust into my hand a
   424	steaming mug with an “’Ere, this’ll do yer good.”  It was a nauseous
   425	mess,—ship’s coffee,—but the heat of it was revivifying.  Between gulps
   426	of the molten stuff I glanced down at my raw and bleeding chest and
   427	turned to the Scandinavian.
   428	
   429	“Thank you, Mr. Yonson,” I said; “but don’t you think your measures were
   430	rather heroic?”
   431	
   432	It was because he understood the reproof of my action, rather than of my
   433	words, that he held up his palm for inspection.  It was remarkably
   434	calloused.  I passed my hand over the horny projections, and my teeth
   435	went on edge once more from the horrible rasping sensation produced.
   436	
   437	“My name is Johnson, not Yonson,” he said, in very good, though slow,
   438	English, with no more than a shade of accent to it.
   439	
   440	There was mild protest in his pale blue eyes, and withal a timid
   441	frankness and manliness that quite won me to him.
   442	
   443	“Thank you, Mr. Johnson,” I corrected, and reached out my hand for his.
   444	
   445	He hesitated, awkward and bashful, shifted his weight from one leg to the
   446	other, then blunderingly gripped my hand in a hearty shake.
   447	
   448	“Have you any dry clothes I may put on?” I asked the cook.
   449	
   450	“Yes, sir,” he answered, with cheerful alacrity.  “I’ll run down an’ tyke
   451	a look over my kit, if you’ve no objections, sir, to wearin’ my things.”
   452	
   453	He dived out of the galley door, or glided rather, with a swiftness and
   454	smoothness of gait that struck me as being not so much cat-like as oily.
   455	In fact, this oiliness, or greasiness, as I was later to learn, was
   456	probably the most salient expression of his personality.
   457	
   458	“And where am I?” I asked Johnson, whom I took, and rightly, to be one of
   459	the sailors.  “What vessel is this, and where is she bound?”
   460	
   461	“Off the Farallones, heading about sou-west,” he answered, slowly and
   462	methodically, as though groping for his best English, and rigidly
   463	observing the order of my queries.  “The schooner _Ghost_, bound
   464	seal-hunting to Japan.”
   465	
   466	“And who is the captain?  I must see him as soon as I am dressed.”
   467	
   468	Johnson looked puzzled and embarrassed.  He hesitated while he groped in
   469	his vocabulary and framed a complete answer.  “The cap’n is Wolf Larsen,
   470	or so men call him.  I never heard his other name.  But you better speak
   471	soft with him.  He is mad this morning.  The mate—”
   472	
   473	But he did not finish.  The cook had glided in.
   474	
   475	“Better sling yer ’ook out of ’ere, Yonson,” he said.  “The old man’ll be
   476	wantin’ yer on deck, an’ this ayn’t no d’y to fall foul of ’im.”
   477	
   478	Johnson turned obediently to the door, at the same time, over the cook’s
   479	shoulder, favouring me with an amazingly solemn and portentous wink as
   480	though to emphasize his interrupted remark and the need for me to be
   481	soft-spoken with the captain.
   482	
   483	Hanging over the cook’s arm was a loose and crumpled array of
   484	evil-looking and sour-smelling garments.
   485	
   486	“They was put aw’y wet, sir,” he vouchsafed explanation.  “But you’ll
   487	’ave to make them do till I dry yours out by the fire.”
   488	
   489	Clinging to the woodwork, staggering with the roll of the ship, and aided
   490	by the cook, I managed to slip into a rough woollen undershirt.  On the
   491	instant my flesh was creeping and crawling from the harsh contact.  He
   492	noticed my involuntary twitching and grimacing, and smirked:
   493	
   494	“I only ’ope yer don’t ever ’ave to get used to such as that in this
   495	life, ’cos you’ve got a bloomin’ soft skin, that you ’ave, more like a
   496	lydy’s than any I know of.  I was bloomin’ well sure you was a gentleman
   497	as soon as I set eyes on yer.”
   498	
   499	I had taken a dislike to him at first, and as he helped to dress me this
   500	dislike increased.  There was something repulsive about his touch.  I
   501	shrank from his hand; my flesh revolted.  And between this and the smells
   502	arising from various pots boiling and bubbling on the galley fire, I was
   503	in haste to get out into the fresh air.  Further, there was the need of
   504	seeing the captain about what arrangements could be made for getting me
   505	ashore.
   506	
   507	A cheap cotton shirt, with frayed collar and a bosom discoloured with
   508	what I took to be ancient blood-stains, was put on me amid a running and
   509	apologetic fire of comment.  A pair of workman’s brogans encased my feet,
   510	and for trousers I was furnished with a pair of pale blue, washed-out
   511	overalls, one leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other.
   512	The abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched for the
   513	Cockney’s soul and missed the shadow for the substance.
   514	
   515	“And whom have I to thank for this kindness?” I asked, when I stood
   516	completely arrayed, a tiny boy’s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty,
   517	striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves
   518	of which reached just below my elbows.
   519	
   520	The cook drew himself up in a smugly humble fashion, a deprecating smirk
   521	on his face.  Out of my experience with stewards on the Atlantic liners
   522	at the end of the voyage, I could have sworn he was waiting for his tip.
   523	From my fuller knowledge of the creature I now know that the posture was
   524	unconscious.  An hereditary servility, no doubt, was responsible.
   525	
   526	“Mugridge, sir,” he fawned, his effeminate features running into a greasy
   527	smile.  “Thomas Mugridge, sir, an’ at yer service.”
   528	
   529	“All right, Thomas,” I said.  “I shall not forget you—when my clothes are
   530	dry.”
   531	
   532	A soft light suffused his face and his eyes glistened, as though
   533	somewhere in the deeps of his being his ancestors had quickened and
   534	stirred with dim memories of tips received in former lives.
   535	
   536	“Thank you, sir,” he said, very gratefully and very humbly indeed.
   537	
   538	Precisely in the way that the door slid back, he slid aside, and I
   539	stepped out on deck.  I was still weak from my prolonged immersion.  A
   540	puff of wind caught me,—and I staggered across the moving deck to a
   541	corner of the cabin, to which I clung for support.  The schooner, heeled
   542	over far out from the perpendicular, was bowing and plunging into the
   543	long Pacific roll.  If she were heading south-west as Johnson had said,
   544	the wind, then, I calculated, was blowing nearly from the south.  The fog
   545	was gone, and in its place the sun sparkled crisply on the surface of the
   546	water, I turned to the east, where I knew California must lie, but could
   547	see nothing save low-lying fog-banks—the same fog, doubtless, that had
   548	brought about the disaster to the _Martinez_ and placed me in my present
   549	situation.  To the north, and not far away, a group of naked rocks thrust
   550	above the sea, on one of which I could distinguish a lighthouse.  In the
   551	south-west, and almost in our course, I saw the pyramidal loom of some
   552	vessel’s sails.
   553	
   554	Having completed my survey of the horizon, I turned to my more immediate
   555	surroundings.  My first thought was that a man who had come through a
   556	collision and rubbed shoulders with death merited more attention than I
   557	received.  Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously across the
   558	top of the cabin, I attracted no notice whatever.
   559	
   560	Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amid ships.  There, on a
   561	hatch, a large man was lying on his back.  He was fully clothed, though
   562	his shirt was ripped open in front.  Nothing was to be seen of his chest,
   563	however, for it was covered with a mass of black hair, in appearance like
   564	the furry coat of a dog.  His face and neck were hidden beneath a black
   565	beard, intershot with grey, which would have been stiff and bushy had it
   566	not been limp and draggled and dripping with water.  His eyes were
   567	closed, and he was apparently unconscious; but his mouth was wide open,
   568	his breast, heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for
   569	breath.  A sailor, from time to time and quite methodically, as a matter
   570	of routine, dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean at the end of a rope,
   571	hauled it in hand under hand, and sluiced its contents over the prostrate
   572	man.
   573	
   574	Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely chewing
   575	the end of a cigar, was the man whose casual glance had rescued me from
   576	the sea.  His height was probably five feet ten inches, or ten and a
   577	half; but my first impression, or feel of the man, was not of this, but
   578	of his strength.  And yet, while he was of massive build, with broad
   579	shoulders and deep chest, I could not characterize his strength as
   580	massive.  It was what might be termed a sinewy, knotty strength, of the
   581	kind we ascribe to lean and wiry men, but which, in him, because of his
   582	heavy build, partook more of the enlarged gorilla order.  Not that in
   583	appearance he seemed in the least gorilla-like.  What I am striving to
   584	express is this strength itself, more as a thing apart from his physical
   585	semblance.  It was a strength we are wont to associate with things
   586	primitive, with wild animals, and the creatures we imagine our
   587	tree-dwelling prototypes to have been—a strength savage, ferocious, alive
   588	in itself, the essence of life in that it is the potency of motion, the
   589	elemental stuff itself out of which the many forms of life have been
   590	moulded; in short, that which writhes in the body of a snake when the
   591	head is cut off, and the snake, as a snake, is dead, or which lingers in
   592	the shapeless lump of turtle-meat and recoils and quivers from the prod
   593	of a finger.
   594	
   595	Such was the impression of strength I gathered from this man who paced up
   596	and down.  He was firmly planted on his legs; his feet struck the deck
   597	squarely and with surety; every movement of a muscle, from the heave of
   598	the shoulders to the tightening of the lips about the cigar, was
   599	decisive, and seemed to come out of a strength that was excessive and
   600	overwhelming.  In fact, though this strength pervaded every action of
   601	his, it seemed but the advertisement of a greater strength that lurked
   602	within, that lay dormant and no more than stirred from time to time, but
   603	which might arouse, at any moment, terrible and compelling, like the rage
   604	of a lion or the wrath of a storm.
   605	
   606	The cook stuck his head out of the galley door and grinned encouragingly
   607	at me, at the same time jerking his thumb in the direction of the man who
   608	paced up and down by the hatchway.  Thus I was given to understand that
   609	he was the captain, the “Old Man,” in the cook’s vernacular, the
   610	individual whom I must interview and put to the trouble of somehow
   611	getting me ashore.  I had half started forward, to get over with what I
   612	was certain would be a stormy five minutes, when a more violent
   613	suffocating paroxysm seized the unfortunate person who was lying on his
   614	back.  He wrenched and writhed about convulsively.  The chin, with the
   615	damp black beard, pointed higher in the air as the back muscles stiffened
   616	and the chest swelled in an unconscious and instinctive effort to get
   617	more air.  Under the whiskers, and all unseen, I knew that the skin was
   618	taking on a purplish hue.
   619	
   620	The captain, or Wolf Larsen, as men called him, ceased pacing and gazed
   621	down at the dying man.  So fierce had this final struggle become that the
   622	sailor paused in the act of flinging more water over him and stared
   623	curiously, the canvas bucket partly tilted and dripping its contents to
   624	the deck.  The dying man beat a tattoo on the hatch with his heels,
   625	straightened out his legs, and stiffened in one great tense effort, and
   626	rolled his head from side to side.  Then the muscles relaxed, the head
   627	stopped rolling, and a sigh, as of profound relief, floated upward from
   628	his lips.  The jaw dropped, the upper lip lifted, and two rows of
   629	tobacco-discoloured teeth appeared.  It seemed as though his features had
   630	frozen into a diabolical grin at the world he had left and outwitted.
   631	
   632	Then a most surprising thing occurred.  The captain broke loose upon the
   633	dead man like a thunderclap.  Oaths rolled from his lips in a continuous
   634	stream.  And they were not namby-pamby oaths, or mere expressions of
   635	indecency.  Each word was a blasphemy, and there were many words.  They
   636	crisped and crackled like electric sparks.  I had never heard anything
   637	like it in my life, nor could I have conceived it possible.  With a turn
   638	for literary expression myself, and a penchant for forcible figures and
   639	phrases, I appreciated, as no other listener, I dare say, the peculiar
   640	vividness and strength and absolute blasphemy of his metaphors.  The
   641	cause of it all, as near as I could make out, was that the man, who was
   642	mate, had gone on a debauch before leaving San Francisco, and then had
   643	the poor taste to die at the beginning of the voyage and leave Wolf
   644	Larsen short-handed.
   645	
   646	It should be unnecessary to state, at least to my friends, that I was
   647	shocked.  Oaths and vile language of any sort had always been repellent
   648	to me.  I felt a wilting sensation, a sinking at the heart, and, I might
   649	just as well say, a giddiness.  To me, death had always been invested
   650	with solemnity and dignity.  It had been peaceful in its occurrence,
   651	sacred in its ceremonial.  But death in its more sordid and terrible
   652	aspects was a thing with which I had been unacquainted till now.  As I
   653	say, while I appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that
   654	swept out of Wolf Larsen’s mouth, I was inexpressibly shocked.  The
   655	scorching torrent was enough to wither the face of the corpse.  I should
   656	not have been surprised if the wet black beard had frizzled and curled
   657	and flared up in smoke and flame.  But the dead man was unconcerned.  He
   658	continued to grin with a sardonic humour, with a cynical mockery and
   659	defiance.  He was master of the situation.
   660	
   661	
   662	
   663	
   664	CHAPTER III
   665	
   666	
   667	Wolf Larsen ceased swearing as suddenly as he had begun.  He relighted
   668	his cigar and glanced around.  His eyes chanced upon the cook.
   669	
   670	“Well, Cooky?” he began, with a suaveness that was cold and of the temper
   671	of steel.
   672	
   673	“Yes, sir,” the cook eagerly interpolated, with appeasing and apologetic
   674	servility.
   675	
   676	“Don’t you think you’ve stretched that neck of yours just about enough?
   677	It’s unhealthy, you know.  The mate’s gone, so I can’t afford to lose you
   678	too.  You must be very, very careful of your health, Cooky.  Understand?”
   679	
   680	His last word, in striking contrast with the smoothness of his previous
   681	utterance, snapped like the lash of a whip.  The cook quailed under it.
   682	
   683	“Yes, sir,” was the meek reply, as the offending head disappeared into
   684	the galley.
   685	
   686	At this sweeping rebuke, which the cook had only pointed, the rest of the
   687	crew became uninterested and fell to work at one task or another.  A
   688	number of men, however, who were lounging about a companion-way between
   689	the galley and hatch, and who did not seem to be sailors, continued
   690	talking in low tones with one another.  These, I afterward learned, were
   691	the hunters, the men who shot the seals, and a very superior breed to
   692	common sailor-folk.
   693	
   694	“Johansen!” Wolf Larsen called out.  A sailor stepped forward obediently.
   695	“Get your palm and needle and sew the beggar up.  You’ll find some old
   696	canvas in the sail-locker.  Make it do.”
   697	
   698	“What’ll I put on his feet, sir?” the man asked, after the customary “Ay,
   699	ay, sir.”
   700	
   701	“We’ll see to that,” Wolf Larsen answered, and elevated his voice in a
   702	call of “Cooky!”
   703	
   704	Thomas Mugridge popped out of his galley like a jack-in-the-box.
   705	
   706	“Go below and fill a sack with coal.”
   707	
   708	“Any of you fellows got a Bible or Prayer-book?” was the captain’s next
   709	demand, this time of the hunters lounging about the companion-way.
   710	
   711	They shook their heads, and some one made a jocular remark which I did
   712	not catch, but which raised a general laugh.
   713	
   714	Wolf Larsen made the same demand of the sailors.  Bibles and Prayer-books
   715	seemed scarce articles, but one of the men volunteered to pursue the
   716	quest amongst the watch below, returning in a minute with the information
   717	that there was none.
   718	
   719	The captain shrugged his shoulders.  “Then we’ll drop him over without
   720	any palavering, unless our clerical-looking castaway has the burial
   721	service at sea by heart.”
   722	
   723	By this time he had swung fully around and was facing me.  “You’re a
   724	preacher, aren’t you?” he asked.
   725	
   726	The hunters,—there were six of them,—to a man, turned and regarded me.  I
   727	was painfully aware of my likeness to a scarecrow.  A laugh went up at my
   728	appearance,—a laugh that was not lessened or softened by the dead man
   729	stretched and grinning on the deck before us; a laugh that was as rough
   730	and harsh and frank as the sea itself; that arose out of coarse feelings
   731	and blunted sensibilities, from natures that knew neither courtesy nor
   732	gentleness.
   733	
   734	Wolf Larsen did not laugh, though his grey eyes lighted with a slight
   735	glint of amusement; and in that moment, having stepped forward quite
   736	close to him, I received my first impression of the man himself, of the
   737	man as apart from his body, and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard
   738	him spew forth.  The face, with large features and strong lines, of the
   739	square order, yet well filled out, was apparently massive at first sight;
   740	but again, as with the body, the massiveness seemed to vanish, and a
   741	conviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual
   742	strength that lay behind, sleeping in the deeps of his being.  The jaw,
   743	the chin, the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above
   744	the eyes,—these, while strong in themselves, unusually strong, seemed to
   745	speak an immense vigour or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond
   746	and out of sight.  There was no sounding such a spirit, no measuring, no
   747	determining of metes and bounds, nor neatly classifying in some
   748	pigeon-hole with others of similar type.
   749	
   750	The eyes—and it was my destiny to know them well—were large and handsome,
   751	wide apart as the true artist’s are wide, sheltering under a heavy brow
   752	and arched over by thick black eyebrows.  The eyes themselves were of
   753	that baffling protean grey which is never twice the same; which runs
   754	through many shades and colourings like intershot silk in sunshine; which
   755	is grey, dark and light, and greenish-grey, and sometimes of the clear
   756	azure of the deep sea.  They were eyes that masked the soul with a
   757	thousand guises, and that sometimes opened, at rare moments, and allowed
   758	it to rush up as though it were about to fare forth nakedly into the
   759	world on some wonderful adventure,—eyes that could brood with the
   760	hopeless sombreness of leaden skies; that could snap and crackle points
   761	of fire like those which sparkle from a whirling sword; that could grow
   762	chill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften
   763	and be all a-dance with love-lights, intense and masculine, luring and
   764	compelling, which at the same time fascinate and dominate women till they
   765	surrender in a gladness of joy and of relief and sacrifice.
   766	
   767	But to return.  I told him that, unhappily for the burial service, I was
   768	not a preacher, when he sharply demanded:
   769	
   770	“What do you do for a living?”
   771	
   772	I confess I had never had such a question asked me before, nor had I ever
   773	canvassed it.  I was quite taken aback, and before I could find myself
   774	had sillily stammered, “I—I am a gentleman.”
   775	
   776	His lip curled in a swift sneer.
   777	
   778	“I have worked, I do work,” I cried impetuously, as though he were my
   779	judge and I required vindication, and at the same time very much aware of
   780	my arrant idiocy in discussing the subject at all.
   781	
   782	“For your living?”
   783	
   784	There was something so imperative and masterful about him that I was
   785	quite beside myself—“rattled,” as Furuseth would have termed it, like a
   786	quaking child before a stern school-master.
   787	
   788	“Who feeds you?” was his next question.
   789	
   790	“I have an income,” I answered stoutly, and could have bitten my tongue
   791	the next instant.  “All of which, you will pardon my observing, has
   792	nothing whatsoever to do with what I wish to see you about.”
   793	
   794	But he disregarded my protest.
   795	
   796	“Who earned it?  Eh?  I thought so.  Your father.  You stand on dead
   797	men’s legs.  You’ve never had any of your own.  You couldn’t walk alone
   798	between two sunrises and hustle the meat for your belly for three meals.
   799	Let me see your hand.”
   800	
   801	His tremendous, dormant strength must have stirred, swiftly and
   802	accurately, or I must have slept a moment, for before I knew it he had
   803	stepped two paces forward, gripped my right hand in his, and held it up
   804	for inspection.  I tried to withdraw it, but his fingers tightened,
   805	without visible effort, till I thought mine would be crushed.  It is hard
   806	to maintain one’s dignity under such circumstances.  I could not squirm
   807	or struggle like a schoolboy.  Nor could I attack such a creature who had
   808	but to twist my arm to break it.  Nothing remained but to stand still and
   809	accept the indignity.  I had time to notice that the pockets of the dead
   810	man had been emptied on the deck, and that his body and his grin had been
   811	wrapped from view in canvas, the folds of which the sailor, Johansen, was
   812	sewing together with coarse white twine, shoving the needle through with
   813	a leather contrivance fitted on the palm of his hand.
   814	
   815	Wolf Larsen dropped my hand with a flirt of disdain.
   816	
   817	“Dead men’s hands have kept it soft.  Good for little else than
   818	dish-washing and scullion work.”
   819	
   820	“I wish to be put ashore,” I said firmly, for I now had myself in
   821	control.  “I shall pay you whatever you judge your delay and trouble to
   822	be worth.”
   823	
   824	He looked at me curiously.  Mockery shone in his eyes.
   825	
   826	“I have a counter proposition to make, and for the good of your soul.  My
   827	mate’s gone, and there’ll be a lot of promotion.  A sailor comes aft to
   828	take mate’s place, cabin-boy goes for’ard to take sailor’s place, and you
   829	take the cabin-boy’s place, sign the articles for the cruise, twenty
   830	dollars per month and found.  Now what do you say?  And mind you, it’s
   831	for your own soul’s sake.  It will be the making of you.  You might learn
   832	in time to stand on your own legs, and perhaps to toddle along a bit.”
   833	
   834	But I took no notice.  The sails of the vessel I had seen off to the
   835	south-west had grown larger and plainer.  They were of the same
   836	schooner-rig as the _Ghost_, though the hull itself, I could see, was
   837	smaller.  She was a pretty sight, leaping and flying toward us, and
   838	evidently bound to pass at close range.  The wind had been momentarily
   839	increasing, and the sun, after a few angry gleams, had disappeared.  The
   840	sea had turned a dull leaden grey and grown rougher, and was now tossing
   841	foaming whitecaps to the sky.  We were travelling faster, and heeled
   842	farther over.  Once, in a gust, the rail dipped under the sea, and the
   843	decks on that side were for the moment awash with water that made a
   844	couple of the hunters hastily lift their feet.
   845	
   846	“That vessel will soon be passing us,” I said, after a moment’s pause.
   847	“As she is going in the opposite direction, she is very probably bound
   848	for San Francisco.”
   849	
   850	“Very probably,” was Wolf Larsen’s answer, as he turned partly away from
   851	me and cried out, “Cooky!  Oh, Cooky!”
   852	
   853	The Cockney popped out of the galley.
   854	
   855	“Where’s that boy?  Tell him I want him.”
   856	
   857	“Yes, sir;” and Thomas Mugridge fled swiftly aft and disappeared down
   858	another companion-way near the wheel.  A moment later he emerged, a
   859	heavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen, with a glowering,
   860	villainous countenance, trailing at his heels.
   861	
   862	“’Ere ’e is, sir,” the cook said.
   863	
   864	But Wolf Larsen ignored that worthy, turning at once to the cabin-boy.
   865	
   866	“What’s your name, boy?”
   867	
   868	“George Leach, sir,” came the sullen answer, and the boy’s bearing showed
   869	clearly that he divined the reason for which he had been summoned.
   870	
   871	“Not an Irish name,” the captain snapped sharply.  “O’Toole or McCarthy
   872	would suit your mug a damn sight better.  Unless, very likely, there’s an
   873	Irishman in your mother’s woodpile.”
   874	
   875	I saw the young fellow’s hands clench at the insult, and the blood crawl
   876	scarlet up his neck.
   877	
   878	“But let that go,” Wolf Larsen continued.  “You may have very good
   879	reasons for forgetting your name, and I’ll like you none the worse for it
   880	as long as you toe the mark.  Telegraph Hill, of course, is your port of
   881	entry.  It sticks out all over your mug.  Tough as they make them and
   882	twice as nasty.  I know the kind.  Well, you can make up your mind to
   883	have it taken out of you on this craft.  Understand?  Who shipped you,
   884	anyway?”
   885	
   886	“McCready and Swanson.”
   887	
   888	“Sir!” Wolf Larsen thundered.
   889	
   890	“McCready and Swanson, sir,” the boy corrected, his eyes burning with a
   891	bitter light.
   892	
   893	“Who got the advance money?”
   894	
   895	“They did, sir.”
   896	
   897	“I thought as much.  And damned glad you were to let them have it.
   898	Couldn’t make yourself scarce too quick, with several gentlemen you may
   899	have heard of looking for you.”
   900	
   901	The boy metamorphosed into a savage on the instant.  His body bunched
   902	together as though for a spring, and his face became as an infuriated
   903	beast’s as he snarled, “It’s a—”
   904	
   905	“A what?” Wolf Larsen asked, a peculiar softness in his voice, as though
   906	he were overwhelmingly curious to hear the unspoken word.
   907	
   908	The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper.  “Nothin’, sir.  I take it
   909	back.”
   910	
   911	“And you have shown me I was right.”  This with a gratified smile.  “How
   912	old are you?”
   913	
   914	“Just turned sixteen, sir,”
   915	
   916	“A lie.  You’ll never see eighteen again.  Big for your age at that, with
   917	muscles like a horse.  Pack up your kit and go for’ard into the fo’c’sle.
   918	You’re a boat-puller now.  You’re promoted; see?”
   919	
   920	Without waiting for the boy’s acceptance, the captain turned to the
   921	sailor who had just finished the gruesome task of sewing up the corpse.
   922	“Johansen, do you know anything about navigation?”
   923	
   924	“No, sir,”
   925	
   926	“Well, never mind; you’re mate just the same.  Get your traps aft into
   927	the mate’s berth.”
   928	
   929	“Ay, ay, sir,” was the cheery response, as Johansen started forward.
   930	
   931	In the meantime the erstwhile cabin-boy had not moved.  “What are you
   932	waiting for?” Wolf Larsen demanded.
   933	
   934	“I didn’t sign for boat-puller, sir,” was the reply.  “I signed for
   935	cabin-boy.  An’ I don’t want no boat-pullin’ in mine.”
   936	
   937	“Pack up and go for’ard.”
   938	
   939	This time Wolf Larsen’s command was thrillingly imperative.  The boy
   940	glowered sullenly, but refused to move.
   941	
   942	Then came another stirring of Wolf Larsen’s tremendous strength.  It was
   943	utterly unexpected, and it was over and done with between the ticks of
   944	two seconds.  He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his
   945	fist into the other’s stomach.  At the same moment, as though I had been
   946	struck myself, I felt a sickening shock in the pit of my stomach.  I
   947	instance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the
   948	time, and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality.  The cabin-boy—and
   949	he weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least—crumpled up.  His
   950	body wrapped limply about the fist like a wet rag about a stick.  He
   951	lifted into the air, described a short curve, and struck the deck
   952	alongside the corpse on his head and shoulders, where he lay and writhed
   953	about in agony.
   954	
   955	“Well?” Larsen asked of me.  “Have you made up your mind?”
   956	
   957	I had glanced occasionally at the approaching schooner, and it was now
   958	almost abreast of us and not more than a couple of hundred yards away.
   959	It was a very trim and neat little craft.  I could see a large, black
   960	number on one of its sails, and I had seen pictures of pilot-boats.
   961	
   962	“What vessel is that?” I asked.
   963	
   964	“The pilot-boat _Lady Mine_,” Wolf Larsen answered grimly.  “Got rid of
   965	her pilots and running into San Francisco.  She’ll be there in five or
   966	six hours with this wind.”
   967	
   968	“Will you please signal it, then, so that I may be put ashore.”
   969	
   970	“Sorry, but I’ve lost the signal book overboard,” he remarked, and the
   971	group of hunters grinned.
   972	
   973	I debated a moment, looking him squarely in the eyes.  I had seen the
   974	frightful treatment of the cabin-boy, and knew that I should very
   975	probably receive the same, if not worse.  As I say, I debated with
   976	myself, and then I did what I consider the bravest act of my life.  I ran
   977	to the side, waving my arms and shouting:
   978	
   979	“_Lady Mine_ ahoy!  Take me ashore!  A thousand dollars if you take me
   980	ashore!”
   981	
   982	I waited, watching two men who stood by the wheel, one of them steering.
   983	The other was lifting a megaphone to his lips.  I did not turn my head,
   984	though I expected every moment a killing blow from the human brute behind
   985	me.  At last, after what seemed centuries, unable longer to stand the
   986	strain, I looked around.  He had not moved.  He was standing in the same
   987	position, swaying easily to the roll of the ship and lighting a fresh
   988	cigar.
   989	
   990	“What is the matter?  Anything wrong?”
   991	
   992	This was the cry from the _Lady Mine_.
   993	
   994	“Yes!” I shouted, at the top of my lungs.  “Life or death!  One thousand
   995	dollars if you take me ashore!”
   996	
   997	“Too much ’Frisco tanglefoot for the health of my crew!” Wolf Larsen
   998	shouted after.  “This one”—indicating me with his thumb—“fancies
   999	sea-serpents and monkeys just now!”
  1000	
  1001	The man on the _Lady Mine_ laughed back through the megaphone.  The
  1002	pilot-boat plunged past.
  1003	
  1004	“Give him hell for me!” came a final cry, and the two men waved their
  1005	arms in farewell.
  1006	
  1007	I leaned despairingly over the rail, watching the trim little schooner
  1008	swiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us.  And she would
  1009	probably be in San Francisco in five or six hours!  My head seemed
  1010	bursting.  There was an ache in my throat as though my heart were up in
  1011	it.  A curling wave struck the side and splashed salt spray on my lips.
  1012	The wind puffed strongly, and the _Ghost_ heeled far over, burying her
  1013	lee rail.  I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck.
  1014	
  1015	When I turned around, a moment later, I saw the cabin-boy staggering to
  1016	his feet.  His face was ghastly white, twitching with suppressed pain.
  1017	He looked very sick.
  1018	
  1019	“Well, Leach, are you going for’ard?” Wolf Larsen asked.
  1020	
  1021	“Yes, sir,” came the answer of a spirit cowed.
  1022	
  1023	“And you?” I was asked.
  1024	
  1025	“I’ll give you a thousand—” I began, but was interrupted.
  1026	
  1027	“Stow that!  Are you going to take up your duties as cabin-boy?  Or do I
  1028	have to take you in hand?”
  1029	
  1030	What was I to do?  To be brutally beaten, to be killed perhaps, would not
  1031	help my case.  I looked steadily into the cruel grey eyes.  They might
  1032	have been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they
  1033	contained.  One may see the soul stir in some men’s eyes, but his were
  1034	bleak, and cold, and grey as the sea itself.
  1035	
  1036	“Well?”
  1037	
  1038	“Yes,” I said.
  1039	
  1040	“Say ‘yes, sir.’”
  1041	
  1042	“Yes, sir,” I corrected.
  1043	
  1044	“What is your name?”
  1045	
  1046	“Van Weyden, sir.”
  1047	
  1048	“First name?”
  1049	
  1050	“Humphrey, sir; Humphrey Van Weyden.”
  1051	
  1052	“Age?”
  1053	
  1054	“Thirty-five, sir.”
  1055	
  1056	“That’ll do.  Go to the cook and learn your duties.”
  1057	
  1058	And thus it was that I passed into a state of involuntary servitude to
  1059	Wolf Larsen.  He was stronger than I, that was all.  But it was very
  1060	unreal at the time.  It is no less unreal now that I look back upon it.
  1061	It will always be to me a monstrous, inconceivable thing, a horrible
  1062	nightmare.
  1063	
  1064	“Hold on, don’t go yet.”
  1065	
  1066	I stopped obediently in my walk toward the galley.
  1067	
  1068	“Johansen, call all hands.  Now that we’ve everything cleaned up, we’ll
  1069	have the funeral and get the decks cleared of useless lumber.”
  1070	
  1071	While Johansen was summoning the watch below, a couple of sailors, under
  1072	the captain’s direction, laid the canvas-swathed corpse upon a
  1073	hatch-cover.  On either side the deck, against the rail and bottoms up,
  1074	were lashed a number of small boats.  Several men picked up the
  1075	hatch-cover with its ghastly freight, carried it to the lee side, and
  1076	rested it on the boats, the feet pointing overboard.  To the feet was
  1077	attached the sack of coal which the cook had fetched.
  1078	
  1079	I had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and
  1080	awe-inspiring event, but I was quickly disillusioned, by this burial at
  1081	any rate.  One of the hunters, a little dark-eyed man whom his mates
  1082	called “Smoke,” was telling stories, liberally intersprinkled with oaths
  1083	and obscenities; and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth
  1084	to a laughter that sounded to me like a wolf-chorus or the barking of
  1085	hell-hounds.  The sailors trooped noisily aft, some of the watch below
  1086	rubbing the sleep from their eyes, and talked in low tones together.
  1087	There was an ominous and worried expression on their faces.  It was
  1088	evident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a
  1089	captain and begun so inauspiciously.  From time to time they stole
  1090	glances at Wolf Larsen, and I could see that they were apprehensive of
  1091	the man.
  1092	
  1093	He stepped up to the hatch-cover, and all caps came off.  I ran my eyes
  1094	over them—twenty men all told; twenty-two including the man at the wheel
  1095	and myself.  I was pardonably curious in my survey, for it appeared my
  1096	fate to be pent up with them on this miniature floating world for I knew
  1097	not how many weeks or months.  The sailors, in the main, were English and
  1098	Scandinavian, and their faces seemed of the heavy, stolid order.  The
  1099	hunters, on the other hand, had stronger and more diversified faces, with
  1100	hard lines and the marks of the free play of passions.  Strange to say,
  1101	and I noted it all once, Wolf Larsen’s features showed no such evil
  1102	stamp.  There seemed nothing vicious in them.  True, there were lines,
  1103	but they were the lines of decision and firmness.  It seemed, rather, a
  1104	frank and open countenance, which frankness or openness was enhanced by
  1105	the fact that he was smooth-shaven.  I could hardly believe—until the
  1106	next incident occurred—that it was the face of a man who could behave as
  1107	he had behaved to the cabin-boy.
  1108	
  1109	At this moment, as he opened his mouth to speak, puff after puff struck
  1110	the schooner and pressed her side under.  The wind shrieked a wild song
  1111	through the rigging.  Some of the hunters glanced anxiously aloft.  The
  1112	lee rail, where the dead man lay, was buried in the sea, and as the
  1113	schooner lifted and righted the water swept across the deck wetting us
  1114	above our shoe-tops.  A shower of rain drove down upon us, each drop
  1115	stinging like a hailstone.  As it passed, Wolf Larsen began to speak, the
  1116	bare-headed men swaying in unison, to the heave and lunge of the deck.
  1117	
  1118	“I only remember one part of the service,” he said, “and that is, ‘And
  1119	the body shall be cast into the sea.’  So cast it in.”
  1120	
  1121	He ceased speaking.  The men holding the hatch-cover seemed perplexed,
  1122	puzzled no doubt by the briefness of the ceremony.  He burst upon them in
  1123	a fury.
  1124	
  1125	“Lift up that end there, damn you!  What the hell’s the matter with you?”
  1126	
  1127	They elevated the end of the hatch-cover with pitiful haste, and, like a
  1128	dog flung overside, the dead man slid feet first into the sea.  The coal
  1129	at his feet dragged him down.  He was gone.
  1130	
  1131	“Johansen,” Wolf Larsen said briskly to the new mate, “keep all hands on
  1132	deck now they’re here.  Get in the topsails and jibs and make a good job
  1133	of it.  We’re in for a sou’-easter.  Better reef the jib and mainsail
  1134	too, while you’re about it.”
  1135	
  1136	In a moment the decks were in commotion, Johansen bellowing orders and
  1137	the men pulling or letting go ropes of various sorts—all naturally
  1138	confusing to a landsman such as myself.  But it was the heartlessness of
  1139	it that especially struck me.  The dead man was an episode that was past,
  1140	an incident that was dropped, in a canvas covering with a sack of coal,
  1141	while the ship sped along and her work went on.  Nobody had been
  1142	affected.  The hunters were laughing at a fresh story of Smoke’s; the men
  1143	pulling and hauling, and two of them climbing aloft; Wolf Larsen was
  1144	studying the clouding sky to windward; and the dead man, dying obscenely,
  1145	buried sordidly, and sinking down, down—
  1146	
  1147	Then it was that the cruelty of the sea, its relentlessness and
  1148	awfulness, rushed upon me.  Life had become cheap and tawdry, a beastly
  1149	and inarticulate thing, a soulless stirring of the ooze and slime.  I
  1150	held on to the weather rail, close by the shrouds, and gazed out across
  1151	the desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San
  1152	Francisco and the California coast.  Rain-squalls were driving in
  1153	between, and I could scarcely see the fog.  And this strange vessel, with
  1154	its terrible men, pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and
  1155	out, was heading away into the south-west, into the great and lonely
  1156	Pacific expanse.
  1157	
  1158	
  1159	
  1160	
  1161	CHAPTER IV
  1162	
  1163	
  1164	What happened to me next on the sealing-schooner _Ghost_, as I strove to
  1165	fit into my new environment, are matters of humiliation and pain.  The
  1166	cook, who was called “the doctor” by the crew, “Tommy” by the hunters,
  1167	and “Cooky” by Wolf Larsen, was a changed person.  The difference worked
  1168	in my status brought about a corresponding difference in treatment from
  1169	him.  Servile and fawning as he had been before, he was now as
  1170	domineering and bellicose.  In truth, I was no longer the fine gentleman
  1171	with a skin soft as a “lydy’s,” but only an ordinary and very worthless
  1172	cabin-boy.
  1173	
  1174	He absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr. Mugridge, and his
  1175	behaviour and carriage were insufferable as he showed me my duties.
  1176	Besides my work in the cabin, with its four small state-rooms, I was
  1177	supposed to be his assistant in the galley, and my colossal ignorance
  1178	concerning such things as peeling potatoes or washing greasy pots was a
  1179	source of unending and sarcastic wonder to him.  He refused to take into
  1180	consideration what I was, or, rather, what my life and the things I was
  1181	accustomed to had been.  This was part of the attitude he chose to adopt
  1182	toward me; and I confess, ere the day was done, that I hated him with
  1183	more lively feelings than I had ever hated any one in my life before.
  1184	
  1185	This first day was made more difficult for me from the fact that the
  1186	_Ghost_, under close reefs (terms such as these I did not learn till
  1187	later), was plunging through what Mr. Mugridge called an “’owlin’
  1188	sou’-easter.”  At half-past five, under his directions, I set the table
  1189	in the cabin, with rough-weather trays in place, and then carried the tea
  1190	and cooked food down from the galley.  In this connection I cannot
  1191	forbear relating my first experience with a boarding sea.
  1192	
  1193	“Look sharp or you’ll get doused,” was Mr. Mugridge’s parting injunction,
  1194	as I left the galley with a big tea-pot in one hand, and in the hollow of
  1195	the other arm several loaves of fresh-baked bread.  One of the hunters, a
  1196	tall, loose-jointed chap named Henderson, was going aft at the time from
  1197	the steerage (the name the hunters facetiously gave their midships
  1198	sleeping quarters) to the cabin.  Wolf Larsen was on the poop, smoking
  1199	his everlasting cigar.
  1200	
  1201	“’Ere she comes.  Sling yer ’ook!” the cook cried.
  1202	
  1203	I stopped, for I did not know what was coming, and saw the galley door
  1204	slide shut with a bang.  Then I saw Henderson leaping like a madman for
  1205	the main rigging, up which he shot, on the inside, till he was many feet
  1206	higher than my head.  Also I saw a great wave, curling and foaming,
  1207	poised far above the rail.  I was directly under it.  My mind did not
  1208	work quickly, everything was so new and strange.  I grasped that I was in
  1209	danger, but that was all.  I stood still, in trepidation.  Then Wolf
  1210	Larsen shouted from the poop:
  1211	
  1212	“Grab hold something, you—you Hump!”
  1213	
  1214	But it was too late.  I sprang toward the rigging, to which I might have
  1215	clung, and was met by the descending wall of water.  What happened after
  1216	that was very confusing.  I was beneath the water, suffocating and
  1217	drowning.  My feet were out from under me, and I was turning over and
  1218	over and being swept along I knew not where.  Several times I collided
  1219	against hard objects, once striking my right knee a terrible blow.  Then
  1220	the flood seemed suddenly to subside and I was breathing the good air
  1221	again.  I had been swept against the galley and around the steerage
  1222	companion-way from the weather side into the lee scuppers.  The pain from
  1223	my hurt knee was agonizing.  I could not put my weight on it, or, at
  1224	least, I thought I could not put my weight on it; and I felt sure the leg
  1225	was broken.  But the cook was after me, shouting through the lee galley
  1226	door:
  1227	
  1228	“’Ere, you!  Don’t tyke all night about it!  Where’s the pot?  Lost
  1229	overboard?  Serve you bloody well right if yer neck was broke!”
  1230	
  1231	I managed to struggle to my feet.  The great tea-pot was still in my
  1232	hand.  I limped to the galley and handed it to him.  But he was consumed
  1233	with indignation, real or feigned.
  1234	
  1235	“Gawd blime me if you ayn’t a slob.  Wot ’re you good for anyw’y, I’d
  1236	like to know?  Eh?  Wot ’re you good for any’wy?  Cawn’t even carry a bit
  1237	of tea aft without losin’ it.  Now I’ll ’ave to boil some more.
  1238	
  1239	“An’ wot ’re you snifflin’ about?” he burst out at me, with renewed rage.
  1240	“’Cos you’ve ’urt yer pore little leg, pore little mamma’s darlin’.”
  1241	
  1242	I was not sniffling, though my face might well have been drawn and
  1243	twitching from the pain.  But I called up all my resolution, set my
  1244	teeth, and hobbled back and forth from galley to cabin and cabin to
  1245	galley without further mishap.  Two things I had acquired by my accident:
  1246	an injured knee-cap that went undressed and from which I suffered for
  1247	weary months, and the name of “Hump,” which Wolf Larsen had called me
  1248	from the poop.  Thereafter, fore and aft, I was known by no other name,
  1249	until the term became a part of my thought-processes and I identified it
  1250	with myself, thought of myself as Hump, as though Hump were I and had
  1251	always been I.
  1252	
  1253	It was no easy task, waiting on the cabin table, where sat Wolf Larsen,
  1254	Johansen, and the six hunters.  The cabin was small, to begin with, and
  1255	to move around, as I was compelled to, was not made easier by the
  1256	schooner’s violent pitching and wallowing.  But what struck me most
  1257	forcibly was the total lack of sympathy on the part of the men whom I
  1258	served.  I could feel my knee through my clothes, swelling, and swelling,
  1259	and I was sick and faint from the pain of it.  I could catch glimpses of
  1260	my face, white and ghastly, distorted with pain, in the cabin mirror.
  1261	All the men must have seen my condition, but not one spoke or took notice
  1262	of me, till I was almost grateful to Wolf Larsen, later on (I was washing
  1263	the dishes), when he said:
  1264	
  1265	“Don’t let a little thing like that bother you.  You’ll get used to such
  1266	things in time.  It may cripple you some, but all the same you’ll be
  1267	learning to walk.
  1268	
  1269	“That’s what you call a paradox, isn’t it?” he added.
  1270	
  1271	He seemed pleased when I nodded my head with the customary “Yes, sir.”
  1272	
  1273	“I suppose you know a bit about literary things?  Eh?  Good.  I’ll have
  1274	some talks with you some time.”
  1275	
  1276	And then, taking no further account of me, he turned his back and went up
  1277	on deck.
  1278	
  1279	That night, when I had finished an endless amount of work, I was sent to
  1280	sleep in the steerage, where I made up a spare bunk.  I was glad to get
  1281	out of the detestable presence of the cook and to be off my feet.  To my
  1282	surprise, my clothes had dried on me and there seemed no indications of
  1283	catching cold, either from the last soaking or from the prolonged soaking
  1284	from the foundering of the _Martinez_.  Under ordinary circumstances,
  1285	after all that I had undergone, I should have been fit for bed and a
  1286	trained nurse.
  1287	
  1288	But my knee was bothering me terribly.  As well as I could make out, the
  1289	kneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the swelling.  As I sat
  1290	in my bunk examining it (the six hunters were all in the steerage,
  1291	smoking and talking in loud voices), Henderson took a passing glance at
  1292	it.
  1293	
  1294	“Looks nasty,” he commented.  “Tie a rag around it, and it’ll be all
  1295	right.”
  1296	
  1297	That was all; and on the land I would have been lying on the broad of my
  1298	back, with a surgeon attending on me, and with strict injunctions to do
  1299	nothing but rest.  But I must do these men justice.  Callous as they were
  1300	to my suffering, they were equally callous to their own when anything
  1301	befell them.  And this was due, I believe, first, to habit; and second,
  1302	to the fact that they were less sensitively organized.  I really believe
  1303	that a finely-organized, high-strung man would suffer twice and thrice as
  1304	much as they from a like injury.
  1305	
  1306	Tired as I was,—exhausted, in fact,—I was prevented from sleeping by the
  1307	pain in my knee.  It was all I could do to keep from groaning aloud.  At
  1308	home I should undoubtedly have given vent to my anguish; but this new and
  1309	elemental environment seemed to call for a savage repression.  Like the
  1310	savage, the attitude of these men was stoical in great things, childish
  1311	in little things.  I remember, later in the voyage, seeing Kerfoot,
  1312	another of the hunters, lose a finger by having it smashed to a jelly;
  1313	and he did not even murmur or change the expression on his face.  Yet I
  1314	have seen the same man, time and again, fly into the most outrageous
  1315	passion over a trifle.
  1316	
  1317	He was doing it now, vociferating, bellowing, waving his arms, and
  1318	cursing like a fiend, and all because of a disagreement with another
  1319	hunter as to whether a seal pup knew instinctively how to swim.  He held
  1320	that it did, that it could swim the moment it was born.  The other
  1321	hunter, Latimer, a lean, Yankee-looking fellow with shrewd,
  1322	narrow-slitted eyes, held otherwise, held that the seal pup was born on
  1323	the land for no other reason than that it could not swim, that its mother
  1324	was compelled to teach it to swim as birds were compelled to teach their
  1325	nestlings how to fly.
  1326	
  1327	For the most part, the remaining four hunters leaned on the table or lay
  1328	in their bunks and left the discussion to the two antagonists.  But they
  1329	were supremely interested, for every little while they ardently took
  1330	sides, and sometimes all were talking at once, till their voices surged
  1331	back and forth in waves of sound like mimic thunder-rolls in the confined
  1332	space.  Childish and immaterial as the topic was, the quality of their
  1333	reasoning was still more childish and immaterial.  In truth, there was
  1334	very little reasoning or none at all.  Their method was one of assertion,
  1335	assumption, and denunciation.  They proved that a seal pup could swim or
  1336	not swim at birth by stating the proposition very bellicosely and then
  1337	following it up with an attack on the opposing man’s judgment, common
  1338	sense, nationality, or past history.  Rebuttal was precisely similar.  I
  1339	have related this in order to show the mental calibre of the men with
  1340	whom I was thrown in contact.  Intellectually they were children,
  1341	inhabiting the physical forms of men.
  1342	
  1343	And they smoked, incessantly smoked, using a coarse, cheap, and
  1344	offensive-smelling tobacco.  The air was thick and murky with the smoke
  1345	of it; and this, combined with the violent movement of the ship as she
  1346	struggled through the storm, would surely have made me sea-sick had I
  1347	been a victim to that malady.  As it was, it made me quite squeamish,
  1348	though this nausea might have been due to the pain of my leg and
  1349	exhaustion.
  1350	
  1351	As I lay there thinking, I naturally dwelt upon myself and my situation.
  1352	It was unparalleled, undreamed-of, that I, Humphrey Van Weyden, a scholar
  1353	and a dilettante, if you please, in things artistic and literary, should
  1354	be lying here on a Bering Sea seal-hunting schooner.  Cabin-boy!  I had
  1355	never done any hard manual labour, or scullion labour, in my life.  I had
  1356	lived a placid, uneventful, sedentary existence all my days—the life of a
  1357	scholar and a recluse on an assured and comfortable income.  Violent life
  1358	and athletic sports had never appealed to me.  I had always been a
  1359	book-worm; so my sisters and father had called me during my childhood.  I
  1360	had gone camping but once in my life, and then I left the party almost at
  1361	its start and returned to the comforts and conveniences of a roof.  And
  1362	here I was, with dreary and endless vistas before me of table-setting,
  1363	potato-peeling, and dish-washing.  And I was not strong.  The doctors had
  1364	always said that I had a remarkable constitution, but I had never
  1365	developed it or my body through exercise.  My muscles were small and
  1366	soft, like a woman’s, or so the doctors had said time and again in the
  1367	course of their attempts to persuade me to go in for physical-culture
  1368	fads.  But I had preferred to use my head rather than my body; and here I
  1369	was, in no fit condition for the rough life in prospect.
  1370	
  1371	These are merely a few of the things that went through my mind, and are
  1372	related for the sake of vindicating myself in advance in the weak and
  1373	helpless _rôle_ I was destined to play.  But I thought, also, of my
  1374	mother and sisters, and pictured their grief.  I was among the missing
  1375	dead of the _Martinez_ disaster, an unrecovered body.  I could see the
  1376	head-lines in the papers; the fellows at the University Club and the
  1377	Bibelot shaking their heads and saying, “Poor chap!”  And I could see
  1378	Charley Furuseth, as I had said good-bye to him that morning, lounging in
  1379	a dressing-gown on the be-pillowed window couch and delivering himself of
  1380	oracular and pessimistic epigrams.
  1381	
  1382	And all the while, rolling, plunging, climbing the moving mountains and
  1383	falling and wallowing in the foaming valleys, the schooner _Ghost_ was
  1384	fighting her way farther and farther into the heart of the Pacific—and I
  1385	was on her.  I could hear the wind above.  It came to my ears as a
  1386	muffled roar.  Now and again feet stamped overhead.  An endless creaking
  1387	was going on all about me, the woodwork and the fittings groaning and
  1388	squeaking and complaining in a thousand keys.  The hunters were still
  1389	arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.  The air was
  1390	filled with oaths and indecent expressions.  I could see their faces,
  1391	flushed and angry, the brutality distorted and emphasized by the sickly
  1392	yellow of the sea-lamps which rocked back and forth with the ship.
  1393	Through the dim smoke-haze the bunks looked like the sleeping dens of
  1394	animals in a menagerie.  Oilskins and sea-boots were hanging from the
  1395	walls, and here and there rifles and shotguns rested securely in the
  1396	racks.  It was a sea-fitting for the buccaneers and pirates of by-gone
  1397	years.  My imagination ran riot, and still I could not sleep.  And it was
  1398	a long, long night, weary and dreary and long.
  1399	
  1400	
  1401	
  1402	
  1403	CHAPTER V
  1404	
  1405	
  1406	But my first night in the hunters’ steerage was also my last.  Next day
  1407	Johansen, the new mate, was routed from the cabin by Wolf Larsen, and
  1408	sent into the steerage to sleep thereafter, while I took possession of
  1409	the tiny cabin state-room, which, on the first day of the voyage, had
  1410	already had two occupants.  The reason for this change was quickly
  1411	learned by the hunters, and became the cause of a deal of grumbling on
  1412	their part.  It seemed that Johansen, in his sleep, lived over each night
  1413	the events of the day.  His incessant talking and shouting and bellowing
  1414	of orders had been too much for Wolf Larsen, who had accordingly foisted
  1415	the nuisance upon his hunters.
  1416	
  1417	After a sleepless night, I arose weak and in agony, to hobble through my
  1418	second day on the _Ghost_.  Thomas Mugridge routed me out at half-past
  1419	five, much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must have routed out his dog;
  1420	but Mr. Mugridge’s brutality to me was paid back in kind and with
  1421	interest.  The unnecessary noise he made (I had lain wide-eyed the whole
  1422	night) must have awakened one of the hunters; for a heavy shoe whizzed
  1423	through the semi-darkness, and Mr. Mugridge, with a sharp howl of pain,
  1424	humbly begged everybody’s pardon.  Later on, in the galley, I noticed
  1425	that his ear was bruised and swollen.  It never went entirely back to its
  1426	normal shape, and was called a “cauliflower ear” by the sailors.
  1427	
  1428	The day was filled with miserable variety.  I had taken my dried clothes
  1429	down from the galley the night before, and the first thing I did was to
  1430	exchange the cook’s garments for them.  I looked for my purse.  In
  1431	addition to some small change (and I have a good memory for such things),
  1432	it had contained one hundred and eighty-five dollars in gold and paper.
  1433	The purse I found, but its contents, with the exception of the small
  1434	silver, had been abstracted.  I spoke to the cook about it, when I went
  1435	on deck to take up my duties in the galley, and though I had looked
  1436	forward to a surly answer, I had not expected the belligerent harangue
  1437	that I received.
  1438	
  1439	“Look ’ere, ’Ump,” he began, a malicious light in his eyes and a snarl in
  1440	his throat; “d’ye want yer nose punched?  If you think I’m a thief, just
  1441	keep it to yerself, or you’ll find ’ow bloody well mistyken you are.
  1442	Strike me blind if this ayn’t gratitude for yer!  ’Ere you come, a pore
  1443	mis’rable specimen of ’uman scum, an’ I tykes yer into my galley an’
  1444	treats yer ’ansom, an’ this is wot I get for it.  Nex’ time you can go to
  1445	’ell, say I, an’ I’ve a good mind to give you what-for anyw’y.”
  1446	
  1447	So saying, he put up his fists and started for me.  To my shame be it, I
  1448	cowered away from the blow and ran out the galley door.  What else was I
  1449	to do?  Force, nothing but force, obtained on this brute-ship.  Moral
  1450	suasion was a thing unknown.  Picture it to yourself: a man of ordinary
  1451	stature, slender of build, and with weak, undeveloped muscles, who has
  1452	lived a peaceful, placid life, and is unused to violence of any sort—what
  1453	could such a man possibly do?  There was no more reason that I should
  1454	stand and face these human beasts than that I should stand and face an
  1455	infuriated bull.
  1456	
  1457	So I thought it out at the time, feeling the need for vindication and
  1458	desiring to be at peace with my conscience.  But this vindication did not
  1459	satisfy.  Nor, to this day can I permit my manhood to look back upon
  1460	those events and feel entirely exonerated.  The situation was something
  1461	that really exceeded rational formulas for conduct and demanded more than
  1462	the cold conclusions of reason.  When viewed in the light of formal
  1463	logic, there is not one thing of which to be ashamed; but nevertheless a
  1464	shame rises within me at the recollection, and in the pride of my manhood
  1465	I feel that my manhood has in unaccountable ways been smirched and
  1466	sullied.
  1467	
  1468	All of which is neither here nor there.  The speed with which I ran from
  1469	the galley caused excruciating pain in my knee, and I sank down
  1470	helplessly at the break of the poop.  But the Cockney had not pursued me.
  1471	
  1472	“Look at ’im run!  Look at ’im run!” I could hear him crying.  “An’ with
  1473	a gyme leg at that!  Come on back, you pore little mamma’s darling.  I
  1474	won’t ’it yer; no, I won’t.”
  1475	
  1476	I came back and went on with my work; and here the episode ended for the
  1477	time, though further developments were yet to take place.  I set the
  1478	breakfast-table in the cabin, and at seven o’clock waited on the hunters
  1479	and officers.  The storm had evidently broken during the night, though a
  1480	huge sea was still running and a stiff wind blowing.  Sail had been made
  1481	in the early watches, so that the _Ghost_ was racing along under
  1482	everything except the two topsails and the flying jib.  These three
  1483	sails, I gathered from the conversation, were to be set immediately after
  1484	breakfast.  I learned, also, that Wolf Larsen was anxious to make the
  1485	most of the storm, which was driving him to the south-west into that
  1486	portion of the sea where he expected to pick up with the north-east
  1487	trades.  It was before this steady wind that he hoped to make the major
  1488	portion of the run to Japan, curving south into the tropics and north
  1489	again as he approached the coast of Asia.
  1490	
  1491	After breakfast I had another unenviable experience.  When I had finished
  1492	washing the dishes, I cleaned the cabin stove and carried the ashes up on
  1493	deck to empty them.  Wolf Larsen and Henderson were standing near the
  1494	wheel, deep in conversation.  The sailor, Johnson, was steering.  As I
  1495	started toward the weather side I saw him make a sudden motion with his
  1496	head, which I mistook for a token of recognition and good-morning.  In
  1497	reality, he was attempting to warn me to throw my ashes over the lee
  1498	side.  Unconscious of my blunder, I passed by Wolf Larsen and the hunter
  1499	and flung the ashes over the side to windward.  The wind drove them back,
  1500	and not only over me, but over Henderson and Wolf Larsen.  The next
  1501	instant the latter kicked me, violently, as a cur is kicked.  I had not
  1502	realized there could be so much pain in a kick.  I reeled away from him
  1503	and leaned against the cabin in a half-fainting condition.  Everything
  1504	was swimming before my eyes, and I turned sick.  The nausea overpowered
  1505	me, and I managed to crawl to the side of the vessel.  But Wolf Larsen
  1506	did not follow me up.  Brushing the ashes from his clothes, he had
  1507	resumed his conversation with Henderson.  Johansen, who had seen the
  1508	affair from the break of the poop, sent a couple of sailors aft to clean
  1509	up the mess.
  1510	
  1511	Later in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different sort.
  1512	Following the cook’s instructions, I had gone into Wolf Larsen’s
  1513	state-room to put it to rights and make the bed.  Against the wall, near
  1514	the head of the bunk, was a rack filled with books.  I glanced over them,
  1515	noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare, Tennyson, Poe, and De
  1516	Quincey.  There were scientific works, too, among which were represented
  1517	men such as Tyndall, Proctor, and Darwin.  Astronomy and physics were
  1518	represented, and I remarked Bulfinch’s _Age of Fable_, Shaw’s _History of
  1519	English and American Literature_, and Johnson’s _Natural History_ in two
  1520	large volumes.  Then there were a number of grammars, such as Metcalf’s,
  1521	and Reed and Kellogg’s; and I smiled as I saw a copy of _The Dean’s
  1522	English_.
  1523	
  1524	I could not reconcile these books with the man from what I had seen of
  1525	him, and I wondered if he could possibly read them.  But when I came to
  1526	make the bed I found, between the blankets, dropped apparently as he had
  1527	sunk off to sleep, a complete Browning, the Cambridge Edition.  It was
  1528	open at “In a Balcony,” and I noticed, here and there, passages
  1529	underlined in pencil.  Further, letting drop the volume during a lurch of
  1530	the ship, a sheet of paper fell out.  It was scrawled over with
  1531	geometrical diagrams and calculations of some sort.
  1532	
  1533	It was patent that this terrible man was no ignorant clod, such as one
  1534	would inevitably suppose him to be from his exhibitions of brutality.  At
  1535	once he became an enigma.  One side or the other of his nature was
  1536	perfectly comprehensible; but both sides together were bewildering.  I
  1537	had already remarked that his language was excellent, marred with an
  1538	occasional slight inaccuracy.  Of course, in common speech with the
  1539	sailors and hunters, it sometimes fairly bristled with errors, which was
  1540	due to the vernacular itself; but in the few words he had held with me it
  1541	had been clear and correct.
  1542	
  1543	This glimpse I had caught of his other side must have emboldened me, for
  1544	I resolved to speak to him about the money I had lost.
  1545	
  1546	“I have been robbed,” I said to him, a little later, when I found him
  1547	pacing up and down the poop alone.
  1548	
  1549	“Sir,” he corrected, not harshly, but sternly.
  1550	
  1551	“I have been robbed, sir,” I amended.
  1552	
  1553	“How did it happen?” he asked.
  1554	
  1555	Then I told him the whole circumstance, how my clothes had been left to
  1556	dry in the galley, and how, later, I was nearly beaten by the cook when I
  1557	mentioned the matter.
  1558	
  1559	He smiled at my recital.  “Pickings,” he concluded; “Cooky’s pickings.
  1560	And don’t you think your miserable life worth the price?  Besides,
  1561	consider it a lesson.  You’ll learn in time how to take care of your
  1562	money for yourself.  I suppose, up to now, your lawyer has done it for
  1563	you, or your business agent.”
  1564	
  1565	I could feel the quiet sneer through his words, but demanded, “How can I
  1566	get it back again?”
  1567	
  1568	“That’s your look-out.  You haven’t any lawyer or business agent now, so
  1569	you’ll have to depend on yourself.  When you get a dollar, hang on to it.
  1570	A man who leaves his money lying around, the way you did, deserves to
  1571	lose it.  Besides, you have sinned.  You have no right to put temptation
  1572	in the way of your fellow-creatures.  You tempted Cooky, and he fell.
  1573	You have placed his immortal soul in jeopardy.  By the way, do you
  1574	believe in the immortal soul?”
  1575	
  1576	His lids lifted lazily as he asked the question, and it seemed that the
  1577	deeps were opening to me and that I was gazing into his soul.  But it was
  1578	an illusion.  Far as it might have seemed, no man has ever seen very far
  1579	into Wolf Larsen’s soul, or seen it at all,—of this I am convinced.  It
  1580	was a very lonely soul, I was to learn, that never unmasked, though at
  1581	rare moments it played at doing so.
  1582	
  1583	“I read immortality in your eyes,” I answered, dropping the “sir,”—an
  1584	experiment, for I thought the intimacy of the conversation warranted it.
  1585	
  1586	He took no notice.  “By that, I take it, you see something that is alive,
  1587	but that necessarily does not have to live for ever.”
  1588	
  1589	“I read more than that,” I continued boldly.
  1590	
  1591	“Then you read consciousness.  You read the consciousness of life that it
  1592	is alive; but still no further away, no endlessness of life.”
  1593	
  1594	How clearly he thought, and how well he expressed what he thought!  From
  1595	regarding me curiously, he turned his head and glanced out over the
  1596	leaden sea to windward.  A bleakness came into his eyes, and the lines of
  1597	his mouth grew severe and harsh.  He was evidently in a pessimistic mood.
  1598	
  1599	“Then to what end?” he demanded abruptly, turning back to me.  “If I am
  1600	immortal—why?”
  1601	
  1602	I halted.  How could I explain my idealism to this man?  How could I put
  1603	into speech a something felt, a something like the strains of music heard
  1604	in sleep, a something that convinced yet transcended utterance?
  1605	
  1606	“What do you believe, then?” I countered.
  1607	
  1608	“I believe that life is a mess,” he answered promptly.  “It is like
  1609	yeast, a ferment, a thing that moves and may move for a minute, an hour,
  1610	a year, or a hundred years, but that in the end will cease to move.  The
  1611	big eat the little that they may continue to move, the strong eat the
  1612	weak that they may retain their strength.  The lucky eat the most and
  1613	move the longest, that is all.  What do you make of those things?”
  1614	
  1615	He swept his arm in an impatient gesture toward a number of the sailors
  1616	who were working on some kind of rope stuff amidships.
  1617	
  1618	“They move, so does the jelly-fish move.  They move in order to eat in
  1619	order that they may keep moving.  There you have it.  They live for their
  1620	belly’s sake, and the belly is for their sake.  It’s a circle; you get
  1621	nowhere.  Neither do they.  In the end they come to a standstill.  They
  1622	move no more.  They are dead.”
  1623	
  1624	“They have dreams,” I interrupted, “radiant, flashing dreams—”
  1625	
  1626	“Of grub,” he concluded sententiously.
  1627	
  1628	“And of more—”
  1629	
  1630	“Grub.  Of a larger appetite and more luck in satisfying it.”  His voice
  1631	sounded harsh.  There was no levity in it.  “For, look you, they dream of
  1632	making lucky voyages which will bring them more money, of becoming the
  1633	mates of ships, of finding fortunes—in short, of being in a better
  1634	position for preying on their fellows, of having all night in, good grub
  1635	and somebody else to do the dirty work.  You and I are just like them.
  1636	There is no difference, except that we have eaten more and better.  I am
  1637	eating them now, and you too.  But in the past you have eaten more than I
  1638	have.  You have slept in soft beds, and worn fine clothes, and eaten good
  1639	meals.  Who made those beds? and those clothes? and those meals?  Not
  1640	you.  You never made anything in your own sweat.  You live on an income
  1641	which your father earned.  You are like a frigate bird swooping down upon
  1642	the boobies and robbing them of the fish they have caught.  You are one
  1643	with a crowd of men who have made what they call a government, who are
  1644	masters of all the other men, and who eat the food the other men get and
  1645	would like to eat themselves.  You wear the warm clothes.  They made the
  1646	clothes, but they shiver in rags and ask you, the lawyer, or business
  1647	agent who handles your money, for a job.”
  1648	
  1649	“But that is beside the matter,” I cried.
  1650	
  1651	“Not at all.”  He was speaking rapidly now, and his eyes were flashing.
  1652	“It is piggishness, and it is life.  Of what use or sense is an
  1653	immortality of piggishness?  What is the end?  What is it all about?  You
  1654	have made no food.  Yet the food you have eaten or wasted might have
  1655	saved the lives of a score of wretches who made the food but did not eat
  1656	it.  What immortal end did you serve? or did they?  Consider yourself and
  1657	me.  What does your boasted immortality amount to when your life runs
  1658	foul of mine?  You would like to go back to the land, which is a
  1659	favourable place for your kind of piggishness.  It is a whim of mine to
  1660	keep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes.  And keep you
  1661	I will.  I may make or break you.  You may die to-day, this week, or next
  1662	month.  I could kill you now, with a blow of my fist, for you are a
  1663	miserable weakling.  But if we are immortal, what is the reason for this?
  1664	To be piggish as you and I have been all our lives does not seem to be
  1665	just the thing for immortals to be doing.  Again, what’s it all about?
  1666	Why have I kept you here?—”
  1667	
  1668	“Because you are stronger,” I managed to blurt out.
  1669	
  1670	“But why stronger?” he went on at once with his perpetual queries.
  1671	“Because I am a bigger bit of the ferment than you?  Don’t you see?
  1672	Don’t you see?”
  1673	
  1674	“But the hopelessness of it,” I protested.
  1675	
  1676	“I agree with you,” he answered.  “Then why move at all, since moving is
  1677	living?  Without moving and being part of the yeast there would be no
  1678	hopelessness.  But,—and there it is,—we want to live and move, though we
  1679	have no reason to, because it happens that it is the nature of life to
  1680	live and move, to want to live and move.  If it were not for this, life
  1681	would be dead.  It is because of this life that is in you that you dream
  1682	of your immortality.  The life that is in you is alive and wants to go on
  1683	being alive for ever.  Bah!  An eternity of piggishness!”
  1684	
  1685	He abruptly turned on his heel and started forward.  He stopped at the
  1686	break of the poop and called me to him.
  1687	
  1688	“By the way, how much was it that Cooky got away with?” he asked.
  1689	
  1690	“One hundred and eighty-five dollars, sir,” I answered.
  1691	
  1692	He nodded his head.  A moment later, as I started down the companion
  1693	stairs to lay the table for dinner, I heard him loudly cursing some men
  1694	amidships.
  1695	
  1696	
  1697	
  1698	
  1699	CHAPTER VI
  1700	
  1701	
  1702	By the following morning the storm had blown itself quite out and the
  1703	_Ghost_ was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath of wind.
  1704	Occasional light airs were felt, however, and Wolf Larsen patrolled the
  1705	poop constantly, his eyes ever searching the sea to the north-eastward,
  1706	from which direction the great trade-wind must blow.
  1707	
  1708	The men were all on deck and busy preparing their various boats for the
  1709	season’s hunting.  There are seven boats aboard, the captain’s dingey,
  1710	and the six which the hunters will use.  Three, a hunter, a boat-puller,
  1711	and a boat-steerer, compose a boat’s crew.  On board the schooner the
  1712	boat-pullers and steerers are the crew.  The hunters, too, are supposed
  1713	to be in command of the watches, subject, always, to the orders of Wolf
  1714	Larsen.
  1715	
  1716	All this, and more, I have learned.  The _Ghost_ is considered the
  1717	fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets.  In fact,
  1718	she was once a private yacht, and was built for speed.  Her lines and
  1719	fittings—though I know nothing about such things—speak for themselves.
  1720	Johnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during
  1721	yesterday’s second dog-watch.  He spoke enthusiastically, with the love
  1722	for a fine craft such as some men feel for horses.  He is greatly
  1723	disgusted with the outlook, and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen
  1724	bears a very unsavoury reputation among the sealing captains.  It was the
  1725	_Ghost_ herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage, but he is
  1726	already beginning to repent.
  1727	
  1728	As he told me, the _Ghost_ is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine
  1729	model.  Her beam, or width, is twenty-three feet, and her length a little
  1730	over ninety feet.  A lead keel of fabulous but unknown weight makes her
  1731	very stable, while she carries an immense spread of canvas.  From the
  1732	deck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet,
  1733	while the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter.  I am
  1734	giving these details so that the size of this little floating world which
  1735	holds twenty-two men may be appreciated.  It is a very little world, a
  1736	mote, a speck, and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a
  1737	contrivance so small and fragile.
  1738	
  1739	Wolf Larsen has, also, a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail.  I
  1740	overheard Henderson and another of the hunters, Standish, a Californian,
  1741	talking about it.  Two years ago he dismasted the _Ghost_ in a gale on
  1742	Bering Sea, whereupon the present masts were put in, which are stronger
  1743	and heavier in every way.  He is said to have remarked, when he put them
  1744	in, that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks.
  1745	
  1746	Every man aboard, with the exception of Johansen, who is rather overcome
  1747	by his promotion, seems to have an excuse for having sailed on the
  1748	_Ghost_.  Half the men forward are deep-water sailors, and their excuse
  1749	is that they did not know anything about her or her captain.  And those
  1750	who do know, whisper that the hunters, while excellent shots, were so
  1751	notorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could
  1752	not sign on any decent schooner.
  1753	
  1754	I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew,—Louis he is
  1755	called, a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman, and a very
  1756	sociable fellow, prone to talk as long as he can find a listener.  In the
  1757	afternoon, while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the
  1758	everlasting potatoes, Louis dropped into the galley for a “yarn.”  His
  1759	excuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed.  He assured
  1760	me again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream
  1761	of doing in a sober moment.  It seems that he has been seal-hunting
  1762	regularly each season for a dozen years, and is accounted one of the two
  1763	or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets.
  1764	
  1765	“Ah, my boy,” he shook his head ominously at me, “’tis the worst schooner
  1766	ye could iv selected, nor were ye drunk at the time as was I.  ’Tis
  1767	sealin’ is the sailor’s paradise—on other ships than this.  The mate was
  1768	the first, but mark me words, there’ll be more dead men before the trip
  1769	is done with.  Hist, now, between you an’ meself and the stanchion there,
  1770	this Wolf Larsen is a regular devil, an’ the _Ghost’ll_ be a hell-ship
  1771	like she’s always ben since he had hold iv her.  Don’t I know?  Don’t I
  1772	know?  Don’t I remember him in Hakodate two years gone, when he had a row
  1773	an’ shot four iv his men?  Wasn’t I a-layin’ on the _Emma L._, not three
  1774	hundred yards away?  An’ there was a man the same year he killed with a
  1775	blow iv his fist.  Yes, sir, killed ’im dead-oh.  His head must iv
  1776	smashed like an eggshell.  An’ wasn’t there the Governor of Kura Island,
  1777	an’ the Chief iv Police, Japanese gentlemen, sir, an’ didn’t they come
  1778	aboard the _Ghost_ as his guests, a-bringin’ their wives along—wee an’
  1779	pretty little bits of things like you see ’em painted on fans.  An’ as he
  1780	was a-gettin’ under way, didn’t the fond husbands get left astern-like in
  1781	their sampan, as it might be by accident?  An’ wasn’t it a week later
  1782	that the poor little ladies was put ashore on the other side of the
  1783	island, with nothin’ before ’em but to walk home acrost the mountains on
  1784	their weeny-teeny little straw sandals which wouldn’t hang together a
  1785	mile?  Don’t I know?  ’Tis the beast he is, this Wolf Larsen—the great
  1786	big beast mentioned iv in Revelation; an’ no good end will he ever come
  1787	to.  But I’ve said nothin’ to ye, mind ye.  I’ve whispered never a word;
  1788	for old fat Louis’ll live the voyage out if the last mother’s son of yez
  1789	go to the fishes.”
  1790	
  1791	“Wolf Larsen!” he snorted a moment later.  “Listen to the word, will ye!
  1792	Wolf—’tis what he is.  He’s not black-hearted like some men.  ’Tis no
  1793	heart he has at all.  Wolf, just wolf, ’tis what he is.  D’ye wonder he’s
  1794	well named?”
  1795	
  1796	“But if he is so well-known for what he is,” I queried, “how is it that
  1797	he can get men to ship with him?”
  1798	
  1799	“An’ how is it ye can get men to do anything on God’s earth an’ sea?”
  1800	Louis demanded with Celtic fire.  “How d’ye find me aboard if ’twasn’t
  1801	that I was drunk as a pig when I put me name down?  There’s them that
  1802	can’t sail with better men, like the hunters, and them that don’t know,
  1803	like the poor devils of wind-jammers for’ard there.  But they’ll come to
  1804	it, they’ll come to it, an’ be sorry the day they was born.  I could weep
  1805	for the poor creatures, did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the
  1806	troubles before him.  But ’tis not a whisper I’ve dropped, mind ye, not a
  1807	whisper.”
  1808	
  1809	“Them hunters is the wicked boys,” he broke forth again, for he suffered
  1810	from a constitutional plethora of speech.  “But wait till they get to
  1811	cutting up iv jinks and rowin’ ’round.  He’s the boy’ll fix ’em.  ’Tis
  1812	him that’ll put the fear of God in their rotten black hearts.  Look at
  1813	that hunter iv mine, Horner.  ‘Jock’ Horner they call him, so quiet-like
  1814	an’ easy-goin’, soft-spoken as a girl, till ye’d think butter wouldn’t
  1815	melt in the mouth iv him.  Didn’t he kill his boat-steerer last year?
  1816	’Twas called a sad accident, but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama an’
  1817	the straight iv it was given me.  An’ there’s Smoke, the black little
  1818	devil—didn’t the Roosians have him for three years in the salt mines of
  1819	Siberia, for poachin’ on Copper Island, which is a Roosian preserve?
  1820	Shackled he was, hand an’ foot, with his mate.  An’ didn’t they have
  1821	words or a ruction of some kind?—for ’twas the other fellow Smoke sent up
  1822	in the buckets to the top of the mine; an’ a piece at a time he went up,
  1823	a leg to-day, an’ to-morrow an arm, the next day the head, an’ so on.”
  1824	
  1825	“But you can’t mean it!” I cried out, overcome with the horror of it.
  1826	
  1827	“Mean what!” he demanded, quick as a flash.  “’Tis nothin’ I’ve said.
  1828	Deef I am, and dumb, as ye should be for the sake iv your mother; an’
  1829	never once have I opened me lips but to say fine things iv them an’ him,
  1830	God curse his soul, an’ may he rot in purgatory ten thousand years, and
  1831	then go down to the last an’ deepest hell iv all!”
  1832	
  1833	Johnson, the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard, seemed
  1834	the least equivocal of the men forward or aft.  In fact, there was
  1835	nothing equivocal about him.  One was struck at once by his
  1836	straightforwardness and manliness, which, in turn, were tempered by a
  1837	modesty which might be mistaken for timidity.  But timid he was not.  He
  1838	seemed, rather, to have the courage of his convictions, the certainty of
  1839	his manhood.  It was this that made him protest, at the commencement of
  1840	our acquaintance, against being called Yonson.  And upon this, and him,
  1841	Louis passed judgment and prophecy.
  1842	
  1843	“’Tis a fine chap, that squarehead Johnson we’ve for’ard with us,” he
  1844	said.  “The best sailorman in the fo’c’sle.  He’s my boat-puller.  But
  1845	it’s to trouble he’ll come with Wolf Larsen, as the sparks fly upward.
  1846	It’s meself that knows.  I can see it brewin’ an’ comin’ up like a storm
  1847	in the sky.  I’ve talked to him like a brother, but it’s little he sees
  1848	in takin’ in his lights or flyin’ false signals.  He grumbles out when
  1849	things don’t go to suit him, and there’ll be always some tell-tale
  1850	carryin’ word iv it aft to the Wolf.  The Wolf is strong, and it’s the
  1851	way of a wolf to hate strength, an’ strength it is he’ll see in
  1852	Johnson—no knucklin’ under, and a ‘Yes, sir, thank ye kindly, sir,’ for a
  1853	curse or a blow.  Oh, she’s a-comin’!  She’s a-comin’!  An’ God knows
  1854	where I’ll get another boat-puller!  What does the fool up an’ say, when
  1855	the old man calls him Yonson, but ‘Me name is Johnson, sir,’ an’ then
  1856	spells it out, letter for letter.  Ye should iv seen the old man’s face!
  1857	I thought he’d let drive at him on the spot.  He didn’t, but he will, an’
  1858	he’ll break that squarehead’s heart, or it’s little I know iv the ways iv
  1859	men on the ships iv the sea.”
  1860	
  1861	Thomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable.  I am compelled to Mister him
  1862	and to Sir him with every speech.  One reason for this is that Wolf
  1863	Larsen seems to have taken a fancy to him.  It is an unprecedented thing,
  1864	I take it, for a captain to be chummy with the cook; but this is
  1865	certainly what Wolf Larsen is doing.  Two or three times he put his head
  1866	into the galley and chaffed Mugridge good-naturedly, and once, this
  1867	afternoon, he stood by the break of the poop and chatted with him for
  1868	fully fifteen minutes.  When it was over, and Mugridge was back in the
  1869	galley, he became greasily radiant, and went about his work, humming
  1870	coster songs in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto.
  1871	
  1872	“I always get along with the officers,” he remarked to me in a
  1873	confidential tone.  “I know the w’y, I do, to myke myself uppreci-yted.
  1874	There was my last skipper—w’y I thought nothin’ of droppin’ down in the
  1875	cabin for a little chat and a friendly glass.  ‘Mugridge,’ sez ’e to me,
  1876	‘Mugridge,’ sez ’e, ‘you’ve missed yer vokytion.’  ‘An’ ’ow’s that?’ sez
  1877	I.  ‘Yer should ’a been born a gentleman, an’ never ’ad to work for yer
  1878	livin’.’  God strike me dead, ’Ump, if that ayn’t wot ’e sez, an’ me
  1879	a-sittin’ there in ’is own cabin, jolly-like an’ comfortable, a-smokin’
  1880	’is cigars an’ drinkin’ ’is rum.”
  1881	
  1882	This chitter-chatter drove me to distraction.  I never heard a voice I
  1883	hated so.  His oily, insinuating tones, his greasy smile and his
  1884	monstrous self-conceit grated on my nerves till sometimes I was all in a
  1885	tremble.  Positively, he was the most disgusting and loathsome person I
  1886	have ever met.  The filth of his cooking was indescribable; and, as he
  1887	cooked everything that was eaten aboard, I was compelled to select what I
  1888	ate with great circumspection, choosing from the least dirty of his
  1889	concoctions.
  1890	
  1891	My hands bothered me a great deal, unused as they were to work.  The
  1892	nails were discoloured and black, while the skin was already grained with
  1893	dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove.  Then blisters came,
  1894	in a painful and never-ending procession, and I had a great burn on my
  1895	forearm, acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching
  1896	against the galley stove.  Nor was my knee any better.  The swelling had
  1897	not gone down, and the cap was still up on edge.  Hobbling about on it
  1898	from morning till night was not helping it any.  What I needed was rest,
  1899	if it were ever to get well.
  1900	
  1901	Rest!  I never before knew the meaning of the word.  I had been resting
  1902	all my life and did not know it.  But now, could I sit still for one
  1903	half-hour and do nothing, not even think, it would be the most
  1904	pleasurable thing in the world.  But it is a revelation, on the other
  1905	hand.  I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working people
  1906	hereafter.  I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing.  From
  1907	half-past five in the morning till ten o’clock at night I am everybody’s
  1908	slave, with not one moment to myself, except such as I can steal near the
  1909	end of the second dog-watch.  Let me pause for a minute to look out over
  1910	the sea sparkling in the sun, or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the
  1911	gaff-topsails, or running out the bowsprit, and I am sure to hear the
  1912	hateful voice, “’Ere, you, ’Ump, no sodgerin’.  I’ve got my peepers on
  1913	yer.”
  1914	
  1915	There are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage, and the gossip is
  1916	going around that Smoke and Henderson have had a fight.  Henderson seems
  1917	the best of the hunters, a slow-going fellow, and hard to rouse; but
  1918	roused he must have been, for Smoke had a bruised and discoloured eye,
  1919	and looked particularly vicious when he came into the cabin for supper.
  1920	
  1921	A cruel thing happened just before supper, indicative of the callousness
  1922	and brutishness of these men.  There is one green hand in the crew,
  1923	Harrison by name, a clumsy-looking country boy, mastered, I imagine, by
  1924	the spirit of adventure, and making his first voyage.  In the light
  1925	baffling airs the schooner had been tacking about a great deal, at which
  1926	times the sails pass from one side to the other and a man is sent aloft
  1927	to shift over the fore-gaff-topsail.  In some way, when Harrison was
  1928	aloft, the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of
  1929	the gaff.  As I understood it, there were two ways of getting it
  1930	cleared,—first, by lowering the foresail, which was comparatively easy
  1931	and without danger; and second, by climbing out the peak-halyards to the
  1932	end of the gaff itself, an exceedingly hazardous performance.
  1933	
  1934	Johansen called out to Harrison to go out the halyards.  It was patent to
  1935	everybody that the boy was afraid.  And well he might be, eighty feet
  1936	above the deck, to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes.  Had
  1937	there been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad, but the _Ghost_
  1938	was rolling emptily in a long sea, and with each roll the canvas flapped
  1939	and boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut.  They were capable
  1940	of snapping a man off like a fly from a whip-lash.
  1941	
  1942	Harrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of him, but
  1943	hesitated.  It was probably the first time he had been aloft in his life.
  1944	Johansen, who had caught the contagion of Wolf Larsen’s masterfulness,
  1945	burst out with a volley of abuse and curses.
  1946	
  1947	“That’ll do, Johansen,” Wolf Larsen said brusquely.  “I’ll have you know
  1948	that I do the swearing on this ship.  If I need your assistance, I’ll
  1949	call you in.”
  1950	
  1951	“Yes, sir,” the mate acknowledged submissively.
  1952	
  1953	In the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards.  I was looking
  1954	up from the galley door, and I could see him trembling, as if with ague,
  1955	in every limb.  He proceeded very slowly and cautiously, an inch at a
  1956	time.  Outlined against the clear blue of the sky, he had the appearance
  1957	of an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web.
  1958	
  1959	It was a slight uphill climb, for the foresail peaked high; and the
  1960	halyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and mast, gave him
  1961	separate holds for hands and feet.  But the trouble lay in that the wind
  1962	was not strong enough nor steady enough to keep the sail full.  When he
  1963	was half-way out, the _Ghost_ took a long roll to windward and back again
  1964	into the hollow between two seas.  Harrison ceased his progress and held
  1965	on tightly.  Eighty feet beneath, I could see the agonized strain of his
  1966	muscles as he gripped for very life.  The sail emptied and the gaff swung
  1967	amid-ships.  The halyards slackened, and, though it all happened very
  1968	quickly, I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body.  Then the
  1969	gag swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness, the great sail boomed
  1970	like a cannon, and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the
  1971	canvas like a volley of rifles.  Harrison, clinging on, made the giddy
  1972	rush through the air.  This rush ceased abruptly.  The halyards became
  1973	instantly taut.  It was the snap of the whip.  His clutch was broken.
  1974	One hand was torn loose from its hold.  The other lingered desperately
  1975	for a moment, and followed.  His body pitched out and down, but in some
  1976	way he managed to save himself with his legs.  He was hanging by them,
  1977	head downward.  A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards
  1978	again; but he was a long time regaining his former position, where he
  1979	hung, a pitiable object.
  1980	
  1981	“I’ll bet he has no appetite for supper,” I heard Wolf Larsen’s voice,
  1982	which came to me from around the corner of the galley.  “Stand from
  1983	under, you, Johansen!  Watch out!  Here she comes!”
  1984	
  1985	In truth, Harrison was very sick, as a person is sea-sick; and for a long
  1986	time he clung to his precarious perch without attempting to move.
  1987	Johansen, however, continued violently to urge him on to the completion
  1988	of his task.
  1989	
  1990	“It is a shame,” I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow and correct
  1991	English.  He was standing by the main rigging, a few feet away from me.
  1992	“The boy is willing enough.  He will learn if he has a chance.  But this
  1993	is—”  He paused awhile, for the word “murder” was his final judgment.
  1994	
  1995	“Hist, will ye!” Louis whispered to him, “For the love iv your mother
  1996	hold your mouth!”
  1997	
  1998	But Johnson, looking on, still continued his grumbling.
  1999	
  2000	“Look here,” the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen, “that’s my
  2001	boat-puller, and I don’t want to lose him.”
  2002	
  2003	“That’s all right, Standish,” was the reply.  “He’s your boat-puller when
  2004	you’ve got him in the boat; but he’s my sailor when I have him aboard,
  2005	and I’ll do what I damn well please with him.”
  2006	
  2007	“But that’s no reason—” Standish began in a torrent of speech.
  2008	
  2009	“That’ll do, easy as she goes,” Wolf Larsen counselled back.  “I’ve told
  2010	you what’s what, and let it stop at that.  The man’s mine, and I’ll make
  2011	soup of him and eat it if I want to.”
  2012	
  2013	There was an angry gleam in the hunter’s eye, but he turned on his heel
  2014	and entered the steerage companion-way, where he remained, looking
  2015	upward.  All hands were on deck now, and all eyes were aloft, where a
  2016	human life was at grapples with death.  The callousness of these men, to
  2017	whom industrial organization gave control of the lives of other men, was
  2018	appalling.  I, who had lived out of the whirl of the world, had never
  2019	dreamed that its work was carried on in such fashion.  Life had always
  2020	seemed a peculiarly sacred thing, but here it counted for nothing, was a
  2021	cipher in the arithmetic of commerce.  I must say, however, that the
  2022	sailors themselves were sympathetic, as instance the case of Johnson; but
  2023	the masters (the hunters and the captain) were heartlessly indifferent.
  2024	Even the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not wish
  2025	to lose his boat-puller.  Had it been some other hunter’s boat-puller,
  2026	he, like them, would have been no more than amused.
  2027	
  2028	But to return to Harrison.  It took Johansen, insulting and reviling the
  2029	poor wretch, fully ten minutes to get him started again.  A little later
  2030	he made the end of the gaff, where, astride the spar itself, he had a
  2031	better chance for holding on.  He cleared the sheet, and was free to
  2032	return, slightly downhill now, along the halyards to the mast.  But he
  2033	had lost his nerve.  Unsafe as was his present position, he was loath to
  2034	forsake it for the more unsafe position on the halyards.
  2035	
  2036	He looked along the airy path he must traverse, and then down to the
  2037	deck.  His eyes were wide and staring, and he was trembling violently.  I
  2038	had never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human face.  Johansen
  2039	called vainly for him to come down.  At any moment he was liable to be
  2040	snapped off the gaff, but he was helpless with fright.  Wolf Larsen,
  2041	walking up and down with Smoke and in conversation, took no more notice
  2042	of him, though he cried sharply, once, to the man at the wheel:
  2043	
  2044	“You’re off your course, my man!  Be careful, unless you’re looking for
  2045	trouble!”
  2046	
  2047	“Ay, ay, sir,” the helmsman responded, putting a couple of spokes down.
  2048	
  2049	He had been guilty of running the _Ghost_ several points off her course
  2050	in order that what little wind there was should fill the foresail and
  2051	hold it steady.  He had striven to help the unfortunate Harrison at the
  2052	risk of incurring Wolf Larsen’s anger.
  2053	
  2054	The time went by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible.  Thomas
  2055	Mugridge, on the other hand, considered it a laughable affair, and was
  2056	continually bobbing his head out the galley door to make jocose remarks.
  2057	How I hated him!  And how my hatred for him grew and grew, during that
  2058	fearful time, to cyclopean dimensions.  For the first time in my life I
  2059	experienced the desire to murder—“saw red,” as some of our picturesque
  2060	writers phrase it.  Life in general might still be sacred, but life in
  2061	the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed.  I
  2062	was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the
  2063	thought flashed through my mind: was I, too, becoming tainted by the
  2064	brutality of my environment?—I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had
  2065	denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment?
  2066	
  2067	Fully half-an-hour went by, and then I saw Johnson and Louis in some sort
  2068	of altercation.  It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis’s detaining arm
  2069	and starting forward.  He crossed the deck, sprang into the fore rigging,
  2070	and began to climb.  But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him.
  2071	
  2072	“Here, you, what are you up to?” he cried.
  2073	
  2074	Johnson’s ascent was arrested.  He looked his captain in the eyes and
  2075	replied slowly:
  2076	
  2077	“I am going to get that boy down.”
  2078	
  2079	“You’ll get down out of that rigging, and damn lively about it!  D’ye
  2080	hear?  Get down!”
  2081	
  2082	Johnson hesitated, but the long years of obedience to the masters of
  2083	ships overpowered him, and he dropped sullenly to the deck and went on
  2084	forward.
  2085	
  2086	At half after five I went below to set the cabin table, but I hardly knew
  2087	what I did, for my eyes and my brain were filled with the vision of a
  2088	man, white-faced and trembling, comically like a bug, clinging to the
  2089	thrashing gaff.  At six o’clock, when I served supper, going on deck to
  2090	get the food from the galley, I saw Harrison, still in the same position.
  2091	The conversation at the table was of other things.  Nobody seemed
  2092	interested in the wantonly imperilled life.  But making an extra trip to
  2093	the galley a little later, I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison
  2094	staggering weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle.  He had
  2095	finally summoned the courage to descend.
  2096	
  2097	Before closing this incident, I must give a scrap of conversation I had
  2098	with Wolf Larsen in the cabin, while I was washing the dishes.
  2099	
  2100	“You were looking squeamish this afternoon,” he began.  “What was the
  2101	matter?”
  2102	
  2103	I could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick as Harrison,
  2104	that he was trying to draw me, and I answered, “It was because of the
  2105	brutal treatment of that boy.”
  2106	
  2107	He gave a short laugh.  “Like sea-sickness, I suppose.  Some men are
  2108	subject to it, and others are not.”
  2109	
  2110	“Not so,” I objected.
  2111	
  2112	“Just so,” he went on.  “The earth is as full of brutality as the sea is
  2113	full of motion.  And some men are made sick by the one, and some by the
  2114	other.  That’s the only reason.”
  2115	
  2116	“But you, who make a mock of human life, don’t you place any value upon
  2117	it whatever?” I demanded.
  2118	
  2119	“Value?  What value?”  He looked at me, and though his eyes were steady
  2120	and motionless, there seemed a cynical smile in them.  “What kind of
  2121	value?  How do you measure it?  Who values it?”
  2122	
  2123	“I do,” I made answer.
  2124	
  2125	“Then what is it worth to you?  Another man’s life, I mean.  Come now,
  2126	what is it worth?”
  2127	
  2128	The value of life?  How could I put a tangible value upon it?  Somehow,
  2129	I, who have always had expression, lacked expression when with Wolf
  2130	Larsen.  I have since determined that a part of it was due to the man’s
  2131	personality, but that the greater part was due to his totally different
  2132	outlook.  Unlike other materialists I had met and with whom I had
  2133	something in common to start on, I had nothing in common with him.
  2134	Perhaps, also, it was the elemental simplicity of his mind that baffled
  2135	me.  He drove so directly to the core of the matter, divesting a question
  2136	always of all superfluous details, and with such an air of finality, that
  2137	I seemed to find myself struggling in deep water, with no footing under
  2138	me.  Value of life?  How could I answer the question on the spur of the
  2139	moment?  The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic.  That it was
  2140	intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned.  But when he
  2141	challenged the truism I was speechless.
  2142	
  2143	“We were talking about this yesterday,” he said.  “I held that life was a
  2144	ferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live, and
  2145	that living was merely successful piggishness.  Why, if there is anything
  2146	in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world.  There is
  2147	only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is
  2148	demanding to be born is limitless.  Nature is a spendthrift.  Look at the
  2149	fish and their millions of eggs.  For that matter, look at you and me.
  2150	In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives.  Could we but
  2151	find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the
  2152	unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and
  2153	populate continents.  Life?  Bah!  It has no value.  Of cheap things it
  2154	is the cheapest.  Everywhere it goes begging.  Nature spills it out with
  2155	a lavish hand.  Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand
  2156	lives, and it’s life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life
  2157	is left.”
  2158	
  2159	“You have read Darwin,” I said.  “But you read him misunderstandingly
  2160	when you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your wanton
  2161	destruction of life.”
  2162	
  2163	He shrugged his shoulders.  “You know you only mean that in relation to
  2164	human life, for of the flesh and the fowl and the fish you destroy as
  2165	much as I or any other man.  And human life is in no wise different,
  2166	though you feel it is and think that you reason why it is.  Why should I
  2167	be parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value?  There
  2168	are more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them, more workers
  2169	than there are factories or machines for them.  Why, you who live on the
  2170	land know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and
  2171	loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remain more
  2172	poor people, dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which
  2173	is life destroyed), than you know what to do with.  Have you ever seen
  2174	the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?”
  2175	
  2176	He started for the companion stairs, but turned his head for a final
  2177	word.  “Do you know the only value life has is what life puts upon
  2178	itself?  And it is of course over-estimated since it is of necessity
  2179	prejudiced in its own favour.  Take that man I had aloft.  He held on as
  2180	if he were a precious thing, a treasure beyond diamonds or rubies.  To
  2181	you?  No.  To me?  Not at all.  To himself?  Yes.  But I do not accept
  2182	his estimate.  He sadly overrates himself.  There is plenty more life
  2183	demanding to be born.  Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck
  2184	like honey from the comb, there would have been no loss to the world.  He
  2185	was worth nothing to the world.  The supply is too large.  To himself
  2186	only was he of value, and to show how fictitious even this value was,
  2187	being dead he is unconscious that he has lost himself.  He alone rated
  2188	himself beyond diamonds and rubies.  Diamonds and rubies are gone, spread
  2189	out on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water, and he does
  2190	not even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone.  He does not lose
  2191	anything, for with the loss of himself he loses the knowledge of loss.
  2192	Don’t you see?  And what have you to say?”
  2193	
  2194	“That you are at least consistent,” was all I could say, and I went on
  2195	washing the dishes.
  2196	
  2197	
  2198	
  2199	
  2200	CHAPTER VII
  2201	
  2202	
  2203	At last, after three days of variable winds, we have caught the
  2204	north-east trades.  I came on deck, after a good night’s rest in spite of
  2205	my poor knee, to find the _Ghost_ foaming along, wing-and-wing, and every
  2206	sail drawing except the jibs, with a fresh breeze astern.  Oh, the wonder
  2207	of the great trade-wind!  All day we sailed, and all night, and the next
  2208	day, and the next, day after day, the wind always astern and blowing
  2209	steadily and strong.  The schooner sailed herself.  There was no pulling
  2210	and hauling on sheets and tackles, no shifting of topsails, no work at
  2211	all for the sailors to do except to steer.  At night when the sun went
  2212	down, the sheets were slackened; in the morning, when they yielded up the
  2213	damp of the dew and relaxed, they were pulled tight again—and that was
  2214	all.
  2215	
  2216	Ten knots, twelve knots, eleven knots, varying from time to time, is the
  2217	speed we are making.  And ever out of the north-east the brave wind
  2218	blows, driving us on our course two hundred and fifty miles between the
  2219	dawns.  It saddens me and gladdens me, the gait with which we are leaving
  2220	San Francisco behind and with which we are foaming down upon the tropics.
  2221	Each day grows perceptibly warmer.  In the second dog-watch the sailors
  2222	come on deck, stripped, and heave buckets of water upon one another from
  2223	overside.  Flying-fish are beginning to be seen, and during the night the
  2224	watch above scrambles over the deck in pursuit of those that fall aboard.
  2225	In the morning, Thomas Mugridge being duly bribed, the galley is
  2226	pleasantly areek with the odour of their frying; while dolphin meat is
  2227	served fore and aft on such occasions as Johnson catches the blazing
  2228	beauties from the bowsprit end.
  2229	
  2230	Johnson seems to spend all his spare time there or aloft at the
  2231	crosstrees, watching the _Ghost_ cleaving the water under press of sail.
  2232	There is passion, adoration, in his eyes, and he goes about in a sort of
  2233	trance, gazing in ecstasy at the swelling sails, the foaming wake, and
  2234	the heave and the run of her over the liquid mountains that are moving
  2235	with us in stately procession.
  2236	
  2237	The days and nights are “all a wonder and a wild delight,” and though I
  2238	have little time from my dreary work, I steal odd moments to gaze and
  2239	gaze at the unending glory of what I never dreamed the world possessed.
  2240	Above, the sky is stainless blue—blue as the sea itself, which under the
  2241	forefoot is of the colour and sheen of azure satin.  All around the
  2242	horizon are pale, fleecy clouds, never changing, never moving, like a
  2243	silver setting for the flawless turquoise sky.
  2244	
  2245	I do not forget one night, when I should have been asleep, of lying on
  2246	the forecastle-head and gazing down at the spectral ripple of foam thrust
  2247	aside by the _Ghost’s_ forefoot.  It sounded like the gurgling of a brook
  2248	over mossy stones in some quiet dell, and the crooning song of it lured
  2249	me away and out of myself till I was no longer Hump the cabin-boy, nor
  2250	Van Weyden, the man who had dreamed away thirty-five years among books.
  2251	But a voice behind me, the unmistakable voice of Wolf Larsen, strong with
  2252	the invincible certitude of the man and mellow with appreciation of the
  2253	words he was quoting, aroused me.
  2254	
  2255	   “‘O the blazing tropic night, when the wake’s a welt of light
  2256	      That holds the hot sky tame,
  2257	   And the steady forefoot snores through the planet-powdered floors
  2258	      Where the scared whale flukes in flame.
  2259	   Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,
  2260	      And her ropes are taut with the dew,
  2261	   For we’re booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
  2262	      We’re sagging south on the Long Trail—the trail that is always
  2263	   new.’”
  2264	
  2265	“Eh, Hump?  How’s it strike you?” he asked, after the due pause which
  2266	words and setting demanded.
  2267	
  2268	I looked into his face.  It was aglow with light, as the sea itself, and
  2269	the eyes were flashing in the starshine.
  2270	
  2271	“It strikes me as remarkable, to say the least, that you should show
  2272	enthusiasm,” I answered coldly.
  2273	
  2274	“Why, man, it’s living! it’s life!” he cried.
  2275	
  2276	“Which is a cheap thing and without value.”  I flung his words at him.
  2277	
  2278	He laughed, and it was the first time I had heard honest mirth in his
  2279	voice.
  2280	
  2281	“Ah, I cannot get you to understand, cannot drive it into your head, what
  2282	a thing this life is.  Of course life is valueless, except to itself.
  2283	And I can tell you that my life is pretty valuable just now—to myself.
  2284	It is beyond price, which you will acknowledge is a terrific overrating,
  2285	but which I cannot help, for it is the life that is in me that makes the
  2286	rating.”
  2287	
  2288	He appeared waiting for the words with which to express the thought that
  2289	was in him, and finally went on.
  2290	
  2291	“Do you know, I am filled with a strange uplift; I feel as if all time
  2292	were echoing through me, as though all powers were mine.  I know truth,
  2293	divine good from evil, right from wrong.  My vision is clear and far.  I
  2294	could almost believe in God.  But,” and his voice changed and the light
  2295	went out of his face,—“what is this condition in which I find myself?
  2296	this joy of living? this exultation of life? this inspiration, I may well
  2297	call it?  It is what comes when there is nothing wrong with one’s
  2298	digestion, when his stomach is in trim and his appetite has an edge, and
  2299	all goes well.  It is the bribe for living, the champagne of the blood,
  2300	the effervescence of the ferment—that makes some men think holy thoughts,
  2301	and other men to see God or to create him when they cannot see him.  That
  2302	is all, the drunkenness of life, the stirring and crawling of the yeast,
  2303	the babbling of the life that is insane with consciousness that it is
  2304	alive.  And—bah!  To-morrow I shall pay for it as the drunkard pays.  And
  2305	I shall know that I must die, at sea most likely, cease crawling of
  2306	myself to be all a-crawl with the corruption of the sea; to be fed upon,
  2307	to be carrion, to yield up all the strength and movement of my muscles
  2308	that it may become strength and movement in fin and scale and the guts of
  2309	fishes.  Bah!  And bah! again.  The champagne is already flat.  The
  2310	sparkle and bubble has gone out and it is a tasteless drink.”
  2311	
  2312	He left me as suddenly as he had come, springing to the deck with the
  2313	weight and softness of a tiger.  The _Ghost_ ploughed on her way.  I
  2314	noted the gurgling forefoot was very like a snore, and as I listened to
  2315	it the effect of Wolf Larsen’s swift rush from sublime exultation to
  2316	despair slowly left me.  Then some deep-water sailor, from the waist of
  2317	the ship, lifted a rich tenor voice in the “Song of the Trade Wind”:
  2318	
  2319	   “Oh, I am the wind the seamen love—
  2320	      I am steady, and strong, and true;
  2321	   They follow my track by the clouds above,
  2322	      O’er the fathomless tropic blue.
  2323	
  2324	                                  * * * * *
  2325	
  2326	   Through daylight and dark I follow the bark
  2327	      I keep like a hound on her trail;
  2328	   I’m strongest at noon, yet under the moon,
  2329	      I stiffen the bunt of her sail.”
  2330	
  2331	
  2332	
  2333	
  2334	CHAPTER VIII
  2335	
  2336	
  2337	Sometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad, or half-mad at least, what of his
  2338	strange moods and vagaries.  At other times I take him for a great man, a
  2339	genius who has never arrived.  And, finally, I am convinced that he is
  2340	the perfect type of the primitive man, born a thousand years or
  2341	generations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of
  2342	civilization.  He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced
  2343	type.  Not only that, but he is very lonely.  There is no congeniality
  2344	between him and the rest of the men aboard ship.  His tremendous virility
  2345	and mental strength wall him apart.  They are more like children to him,
  2346	even the hunters, and as children he treats them, descending perforce to
  2347	their level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies.  Or else
  2348	he probes them with the cruel hand of a vivisectionist, groping about in
  2349	their mental processes and examining their souls as though to see of what
  2350	soul-stuff is made.
  2351	
  2352	I have seen him a score of times, at table, insulting this hunter or
  2353	that, with cool and level eyes and, withal, a certain air of interest,
  2354	pondering their actions or replies or petty rages with a curiosity almost
  2355	laughable to me who stood onlooker and who understood.  Concerning his
  2356	own rages, I am convinced that they are not real, that they are sometimes
  2357	experiments, but that in the main they are the habits of a pose or
  2358	attitude he has seen fit to take toward his fellow-men.  I know, with the
  2359	possible exception of the incident of the dead mate, that I have not seen
  2360	him really angry; nor do I wish ever to see him in a genuine rage, when
  2361	all the force of him is called into play.
  2362	
  2363	While on the question of vagaries, I shall tell what befell Thomas
  2364	Mugridge in the cabin, and at the same time complete an incident upon
  2365	which I have already touched once or twice.  The twelve o’clock dinner
  2366	was over, one day, and I had just finished putting the cabin in order,
  2367	when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs.
  2368	Though the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the
  2369	cabin, in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen,
  2370	and he flitted to and fro, once or twice a day, a timid spectre.
  2371	
  2372	“So you know how to play ‘Nap,’” Wolf Larsen was saying in a pleased sort
  2373	of voice.  “I might have guessed an Englishman would know.  I learned it
  2374	myself in English ships.”
  2375	
  2376	Thomas Mugridge was beside himself, a blithering imbecile, so pleased was
  2377	he at chumming thus with the captain.  The little airs he put on and the
  2378	painful striving to assume the easy carriage of a man born to a dignified
  2379	place in life would have been sickening had they not been ludicrous.  He
  2380	quite ignored my presence, though I credited him with being simply unable
  2381	to see me.  His pale, wishy-washy eyes were swimming like lazy summer
  2382	seas, though what blissful visions they beheld were beyond my
  2383	imagination.
  2384	
  2385	“Get the cards, Hump,” Wolf Larsen ordered, as they took seats at the
  2386	table.  “And bring out the cigars and the whisky you’ll find in my
  2387	berth.”
  2388	
  2389	I returned with the articles in time to hear the Cockney hinting broadly
  2390	that there was a mystery about him, that he might be a gentleman’s son
  2391	gone wrong or something or other; also, that he was a remittance man and
  2392	was paid to keep away from England—“p’yed ’ansomely, sir,” was the way he
  2393	put it; “p’yed ’ansomely to sling my ’ook an’ keep slingin’ it.”
  2394	
  2395	I had brought the customary liquor glasses, but Wolf Larsen frowned,
  2396	shook his head, and signalled with his hands for me to bring the
  2397	tumblers.  These he filled two-thirds full with undiluted whisky—“a
  2398	gentleman’s drink?” quoth Thomas Mugridge,—and they clinked their glasses
  2399	to the glorious game of “Nap,” lighted cigars, and fell to shuffling and
  2400	dealing the cards.
  2401	
  2402	They played for money.  They increased the amounts of the bets.  They
  2403	drank whisky, they drank it neat, and I fetched more.  I do not know
  2404	whether Wolf Larsen cheated or not,—a thing he was thoroughly capable of
  2405	doing,—but he won steadily.  The cook made repeated journeys to his bunk
  2406	for money.  Each time he performed the journey with greater swagger, but
  2407	he never brought more than a few dollars at a time.  He grew maudlin,
  2408	familiar, could hardly see the cards or sit upright.  As a preliminary to
  2409	another journey to his bunk, he hooked Wolf Larsen’s buttonhole with a
  2410	greasy forefinger and vacuously proclaimed and reiterated, “I got money,
  2411	I got money, I tell yer, an’ I’m a gentleman’s son.”
  2412	
  2413	Wolf Larsen was unaffected by the drink, yet he drank glass for glass,
  2414	and if anything his glasses were fuller.  There was no change in him.  He
  2415	did not appear even amused at the other’s antics.
  2416	
  2417	In the end, with loud protestations that he could lose like a gentleman,
  2418	the cook’s last money was staked on the game—and lost.  Whereupon he
  2419	leaned his head on his hands and wept.  Wolf Larsen looked curiously at
  2420	him, as though about to probe and vivisect him, then changed his mind, as
  2421	from the foregone conclusion that there was nothing there to probe.
  2422	
  2423	“Hump,” he said to me, elaborately polite, “kindly take Mr. Mugridge’s
  2424	arm and help him up on deck.  He is not feeling very well.”
  2425	
  2426	“And tell Johnson to douse him with a few buckets of salt water,” he
  2427	added, in a lower tone for my ear alone.
  2428	
  2429	I left Mr. Mugridge on deck, in the hands of a couple of grinning sailors
  2430	who had been told off for the purpose.  Mr. Mugridge was sleepily
  2431	spluttering that he was a gentleman’s son.  But as I descended the
  2432	companion stairs to clear the table I heard him shriek as the first
  2433	bucket of water struck him.
  2434	
  2435	Wolf Larsen was counting his winnings.
  2436	
  2437	“One hundred and eighty-five dollars even,” he said aloud.  “Just as I
  2438	thought.  The beggar came aboard without a cent.”
  2439	
  2440	“And what you have won is mine, sir,” I said boldly.
  2441	
  2442	He favoured me with a quizzical smile.  “Hump, I have studied some
  2443	grammar in my time, and I think your tenses are tangled.  ‘Was mine,’ you
  2444	should have said, not ’is mine.’”
  2445	
  2446	“It is a question, not of grammar, but of ethics,” I answered.
  2447	
  2448	It was possibly a minute before he spoke.
  2449	
  2450	“D’ye know, Hump,” he said, with a slow seriousness which had in it an
  2451	indefinable strain of sadness, “that this is the first time I have heard
  2452	the word ‘ethics’ in the mouth of a man.  You and I are the only men on
  2453	this ship who know its meaning.”
  2454	
  2455	“At one time in my life,” he continued, after another pause, “I dreamed
  2456	that I might some day talk with men who used such language, that I might
  2457	lift myself out of the place in life in which I had been born, and hold
  2458	conversation and mingle with men who talked about just such things as
  2459	ethics.  And this is the first time I have ever heard the word
  2460	pronounced.  Which is all by the way, for you are wrong.  It is a
  2461	question neither of grammar nor ethics, but of fact.”
  2462	
  2463	“I understand,” I said.  “The fact is that you have the money.”
  2464	
  2465	His face brightened.  He seemed pleased at my perspicacity.  “But it is
  2466	avoiding the real question,” I continued, “which is one of right.”
  2467	
  2468	“Ah,” he remarked, with a wry pucker of his mouth, “I see you still
  2469	believe in such things as right and wrong.”
  2470	
  2471	“But don’t you?—at all?” I demanded.
  2472	
  2473	“Not the least bit.  Might is right, and that is all there is to it.
  2474	Weakness is wrong.  Which is a very poor way of saying that it is good
  2475	for oneself to be strong, and evil for oneself to be weak—or better yet,
  2476	it is pleasurable to be strong, because of the profits; painful to be
  2477	weak, because of the penalties.  Just now the possession of this money is
  2478	a pleasurable thing.  It is good for one to possess it.  Being able to
  2479	possess it, I wrong myself and the life that is in me if I give it to you
  2480	and forego the pleasure of possessing it.”
  2481	
  2482	“But you wrong me by withholding it,” I objected.
  2483	
  2484	“Not at all.  One man cannot wrong another man.  He can only wrong
  2485	himself.  As I see it, I do wrong always when I consider the interests of
  2486	others.  Don’t you see?  How can two particles of the yeast wrong each
  2487	other by striving to devour each other?  It is their inborn heritage to
  2488	strive to devour, and to strive not to be devoured.  When they depart
  2489	from this they sin.”
  2490	
  2491	“Then you don’t believe in altruism?” I asked.
  2492	
  2493	He received the word as if it had a familiar ring, though he pondered it
  2494	thoughtfully.  “Let me see, it means something about coöperation, doesn’t
  2495	it?”
  2496	
  2497	“Well, in a way there has come to be a sort of connection,” I answered
  2498	unsurprised by this time at such gaps in his vocabulary, which, like his
  2499	knowledge, was the acquirement of a self-read, self-educated man, whom no
  2500	one had directed in his studies, and who had thought much and talked
  2501	little or not at all.  “An altruistic act is an act performed for the
  2502	welfare of others.  It is unselfish, as opposed to an act performed for
  2503	self, which is selfish.”
  2504	
  2505	He nodded his head.  “Oh, yes, I remember it now.  I ran across it in
  2506	Spencer.”
  2507	
  2508	“Spencer!” I cried.  “Have you read him?”
  2509	
  2510	“Not very much,” was his confession.  “I understood quite a good deal of
  2511	_First Principles_, but his _Biology_ took the wind out of my sails, and
  2512	his _Psychology_ left me butting around in the doldrums for many a day.
  2513	I honestly could not understand what he was driving at.  I put it down to
  2514	mental deficiency on my part, but since then I have decided that it was
  2515	for want of preparation.  I had no proper basis.  Only Spencer and myself
  2516	know how hard I hammered.  But I did get something out of his _Data of
  2517	Ethics_.  There’s where I ran across ‘altruism,’ and I remember now how
  2518	it was used.”
  2519	
  2520	I wondered what this man could have got from such a work.  Spencer I
  2521	remembered enough to know that altruism was imperative to his ideal of
  2522	highest conduct.  Wolf Larsen, evidently, had sifted the great
  2523	philosopher’s teachings, rejecting and selecting according to his needs
  2524	and desires.
  2525	
  2526	“What else did you run across?” I asked.
  2527	
  2528	His brows drew in slightly with the mental effort of suitably phrasing
  2529	thoughts which he had never before put into speech.  I felt an elation of
  2530	spirit.  I was groping into his soul-stuff as he made a practice of
  2531	groping in the soul-stuff of others.  I was exploring virgin territory.
  2532	A strange, a terribly strange, region was unrolling itself before my
  2533	eyes.
  2534	
  2535	“In as few words as possible,” he began, “Spencer puts it something like
  2536	this: First, a man must act for his own benefit—to do this is to be moral
  2537	and good.  Next, he must act for the benefit of his children.  And third,
  2538	he must act for the benefit of his race.”
  2539	
  2540	“And the highest, finest, right conduct,” I interjected, “is that act
  2541	which benefits at the same time the man, his children, and his race.”
  2542	
  2543	“I wouldn’t stand for that,” he replied.  “Couldn’t see the necessity for
  2544	it, nor the common sense.  I cut out the race and the children.  I would
  2545	sacrifice nothing for them.  It’s just so much slush and sentiment, and
  2546	you must see it yourself, at least for one who does not believe in
  2547	eternal life.  With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying
  2548	business proposition.  I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes.
  2549	But with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell
  2550	this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be
  2551	immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice.  Any sacrifice
  2552	that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,—and not only foolish,
  2553	for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing.  I must not lose one
  2554	crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment.  Nor will the
  2555	eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the
  2556	sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.”
  2557	
  2558	“Then you are an individualist, a materialist, and, logically, a
  2559	hedonist.”
  2560	
  2561	“Big words,” he smiled.  “But what is a hedonist?”
  2562	
  2563	He nodded agreement when I had given the definition.  “And you are also,”
  2564	I continued, “a man one could not trust in the least thing where it was
  2565	possible for a selfish interest to intervene?”
  2566	
  2567	“Now you’re beginning to understand,” he said, brightening.
  2568	
  2569	“You are a man utterly without what the world calls morals?”
  2570	
  2571	“That’s it.”
  2572	
  2573	“A man of whom to be always afraid—”
  2574	
  2575	“That’s the way to put it.”
  2576	
  2577	“As one is afraid of a snake, or a tiger, or a shark?”
  2578	
  2579	“Now you know me,” he said.  “And you know me as I am generally known.
  2580	Other men call me ‘Wolf.’”
  2581	
  2582	“You are a sort of monster,” I added audaciously, “a Caliban who has
  2583	pondered Setebos, and who acts as you act, in idle moments, by whim and
  2584	fancy.”
  2585	
  2586	His brow clouded at the allusion.  He did not understand, and I quickly
  2587	learned that he did not know the poem.
  2588	
  2589	“I’m just reading Browning,” he confessed, “and it’s pretty tough.  I
  2590	haven’t got very far along, and as it is I’ve about lost my bearings.”
  2591	
  2592	Not to be tiresome, I shall say that I fetched the book from his
  2593	state-room and read “Caliban” aloud.  He was delighted.  It was a
  2594	primitive mode of reasoning and of looking at things that he understood
  2595	thoroughly.  He interrupted again and again with comment and criticism.
  2596	When I finished, he had me read it over a second time, and a third.  We
  2597	fell into discussion—philosophy, science, evolution, religion.  He
  2598	betrayed the inaccuracies of the self-read man, and, it must be granted,
  2599	the sureness and directness of the primitive mind.  The very simplicity
  2600	of his reasoning was its strength, and his materialism was far more
  2601	compelling than the subtly complex materialism of Charley Furuseth.  Not
  2602	that I—a confirmed and, as Furuseth phrased it, a temperamental
  2603	idealist—was to be compelled; but that Wolf Larsen stormed the last
  2604	strongholds of my faith with a vigour that received respect, while not
  2605	accorded conviction.
  2606	
  2607	Time passed.  Supper was at hand and the table not laid.  I became
  2608	restless and anxious, and when Thomas Mugridge glared down the
  2609	companion-way, sick and angry of countenance, I prepared to go about my
  2610	duties.  But Wolf Larsen cried out to him:
  2611	
  2612	“Cooky, you’ve got to hustle to-night.  I’m busy with Hump, and you’ll do
  2613	the best you can without him.”
  2614	
  2615	And again the unprecedented was established.  That night I sat at table
  2616	with the captain and the hunters, while Thomas Mugridge waited on us and
  2617	washed the dishes afterward—a whim, a Caliban-mood of Wolf Larsen’s, and
  2618	one I foresaw would bring me trouble.  In the meantime we talked and
  2619	talked, much to the disgust of the hunters, who could not understand a
  2620	word.
  2621	
  2622	
  2623	
  2624	
  2625	CHAPTER IX
  2626	
  2627	
  2628	Three days of rest, three blessed days of rest, are what I had with Wolf
  2629	Larsen, eating at the cabin table and doing nothing but discuss life,
  2630	literature, and the universe, the while Thomas Mugridge fumed and raged
  2631	and did my work as well as his own.
  2632	
  2633	“Watch out for squalls, is all I can say to you,” was Louis’s warning,
  2634	given during a spare half-hour on deck while Wolf Larsen was engaged in
  2635	straightening out a row among the hunters.
  2636	
  2637	“Ye can’t tell what’ll be happenin’,” Louis went on, in response to my
  2638	query for more definite information.  “The man’s as contrary as air
  2639	currents or water currents.  You can never guess the ways iv him.  ’Tis
  2640	just as you’re thinkin’ you know him and are makin’ a favourable slant
  2641	along him, that he whirls around, dead ahead and comes howlin’ down upon
  2642	you and a-rippin’ all iv your fine-weather sails to rags.”
  2643	
  2644	So I was not altogether surprised when the squall foretold by Louis smote
  2645	me.  We had been having a heated discussion,—upon life, of course,—and,
  2646	grown over-bold, I was passing stiff strictures upon Wolf Larsen and the
  2647	life of Wolf Larsen.  In fact, I was vivisecting him and turning over his
  2648	soul-stuff as keenly and thoroughly as it was his custom to do it to
  2649	others.  It may be a weakness of mine that I have an incisive way of
  2650	speech; but I threw all restraint to the winds and cut and slashed until
  2651	the whole man of him was snarling.  The dark sun-bronze of his face went
  2652	black with wrath, his eyes were ablaze.  There was no clearness or sanity
  2653	in them—nothing but the terrific rage of a madman.  It was the wolf in
  2654	him that I saw, and a mad wolf at that.
  2655	
  2656	He sprang for me with a half-roar, gripping my arm.  I had steeled myself
  2657	to brazen it out, though I was trembling inwardly; but the enormous
  2658	strength of the man was too much for my fortitude.  He had gripped me by
  2659	the biceps with his single hand, and when that grip tightened I wilted
  2660	and shrieked aloud.  My feet went out from under me.  I simply could not
  2661	stand upright and endure the agony.  The muscles refused their duty.  The
  2662	pain was too great.  My biceps was being crushed to a pulp.
  2663	
  2664	He seemed to recover himself, for a lucid gleam came into his eyes, and
  2665	he relaxed his hold with a short laugh that was more like a growl.  I
  2666	fell to the floor, feeling very faint, while he sat down, lighted a
  2667	cigar, and watched me as a cat watches a mouse.  As I writhed about I
  2668	could see in his eyes that curiosity I had so often noted, that wonder
  2669	and perplexity, that questing, that everlasting query of his as to what
  2670	it was all about.
  2671	
  2672	I finally crawled to my feet and ascended the companion stairs.  Fair
  2673	weather was over, and there was nothing left but to return to the galley.
  2674	My left arm was numb, as though paralysed, and days passed before I could
  2675	use it, while weeks went by before the last stiffness and pain went out
  2676	of it.  And he had done nothing but put his hand upon my arm and squeeze.
  2677	There had been no wrenching or jerking.  He had just closed his hand with
  2678	a steady pressure.  What he might have done I did not fully realize till
  2679	next day, when he put his head into the galley, and, as a sign of renewed
  2680	friendliness, asked me how my arm was getting on.
  2681	
  2682	“It might have been worse,” he smiled.
  2683	
  2684	I was peeling potatoes.  He picked one up from the pan.  It was
  2685	fair-sized, firm, and unpeeled.  He closed his hand upon it, squeezed,
  2686	and the potato squirted out between his fingers in mushy streams.  The
  2687	pulpy remnant he dropped back into the pan and turned away, and I had a
  2688	sharp vision of how it might have fared with me had the monster put his
  2689	real strength upon me.
  2690	
  2691	But the three days’ rest was good in spite of it all, for it had given my
  2692	knee the very chance it needed.  It felt much better, the swelling had
  2693	materially decreased, and the cap seemed descending into its proper
  2694	place.  Also, the three days’ rest brought the trouble I had foreseen.
  2695	It was plainly Thomas Mugridge’s intention to make me pay for those three
  2696	days.  He treated me vilely, cursed me continually, and heaped his own
  2697	work upon me.  He even ventured to raise his fist to me, but I was
  2698	becoming animal-like myself, and I snarled in his face so terribly that
  2699	it must have frightened him back.  It is no pleasant picture I can
  2700	conjure up of myself, Humphrey Van Weyden, in that noisome ship’s galley,
  2701	crouched in a corner over my task, my face raised to the face of the
  2702	creature about to strike me, my lips lifted and snarling like a dog’s, my
  2703	eyes gleaming with fear and helplessness and the courage that comes of
  2704	fear and helplessness.  I do not like the picture.  It reminds me too
  2705	strongly of a rat in a trap.  I do not care to think of it; but it was
  2706	elective, for the threatened blow did not descend.
  2707	
  2708	Thomas Mugridge backed away, glaring as hatefully and viciously as I
  2709	glared.  A pair of beasts is what we were, penned together and showing
  2710	our teeth.  He was a coward, afraid to strike me because I had not
  2711	quailed sufficiently in advance; so he chose a new way to intimidate me.
  2712	There was only one galley knife that, as a knife, amounted to anything.
  2713	This, through many years of service and wear, had acquired a long, lean
  2714	blade.  It was unusually cruel-looking, and at first I had shuddered
  2715	every time I used it.  The cook borrowed a stone from Johansen and
  2716	proceeded to sharpen the knife.  He did it with great ostentation,
  2717	glancing significantly at me the while.  He whetted it up and down all
  2718	day long.  Every odd moment he could find he had the knife and stone out
  2719	and was whetting away.  The steel acquired a razor edge.  He tried it
  2720	with the ball of his thumb or across the nail.  He shaved hairs from the
  2721	back of his hand, glanced along the edge with microscopic acuteness, and
  2722	found, or feigned that he found, always, a slight inequality in its edge
  2723	somewhere.  Then he would put it on the stone again and whet, whet, whet,
  2724	till I could have laughed aloud, it was so very ludicrous.
  2725	
  2726	It was also serious, for I learned that he was capable of using it, that
  2727	under all his cowardice there was a courage of cowardice, like mine, that
  2728	would impel him to do the very thing his whole nature protested against
  2729	doing and was afraid of doing.  “Cooky’s sharpening his knife for Hump,”
  2730	was being whispered about among the sailors, and some of them twitted him
  2731	about it.  This he took in good part, and was really pleased, nodding his
  2732	head with direful foreknowledge and mystery, until George Leach, the
  2733	erstwhile cabin-boy, ventured some rough pleasantry on the subject.
  2734	
  2735	Now it happened that Leach was one of the sailors told off to douse
  2736	Mugridge after his game of cards with the captain.  Leach had evidently
  2737	done his task with a thoroughness that Mugridge had not forgiven, for
  2738	words followed and evil names involving smirched ancestries.  Mugridge
  2739	menaced with the knife he was sharpening for me.  Leach laughed and
  2740	hurled more of his Telegraph Hill Billingsgate, and before either he or I
  2741	knew what had happened, his right arm had been ripped open from elbow to
  2742	wrist by a quick slash of the knife.  The cook backed away, a fiendish
  2743	expression on his face, the knife held before him in a position of
  2744	defence.  But Leach took it quite calmly, though blood was spouting upon
  2745	the deck as generously as water from a fountain.
  2746	
  2747	“I’m goin’ to get you, Cooky,” he said, “and I’ll get you hard.  And I
  2748	won’t be in no hurry about it.  You’ll be without that knife when I come
  2749	for you.”
  2750	
  2751	So saying, he turned and walked quietly forward.  Mugridge’s face was
  2752	livid with fear at what he had done and at what he might expect sooner or
  2753	later from the man he had stabbed.  But his demeanour toward me was more
  2754	ferocious than ever.  In spite of his fear at the reckoning he must
  2755	expect to pay for what he had done, he could see that it had been an
  2756	object-lesson to me, and he became more domineering and exultant.  Also
  2757	there was a lust in him, akin to madness, which had come with sight of
  2758	the blood he had drawn.  He was beginning to see red in whatever
  2759	direction he looked.  The psychology of it is sadly tangled, and yet I
  2760	could read the workings of his mind as clearly as though it were a
  2761	printed book.
  2762	
  2763	Several days went by, the _Ghost_ still foaming down the trades, and I
  2764	could swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge’s eyes.  And I
  2765	confess that I became afraid, very much afraid.  Whet, whet, whet, it
  2766	went all day long.  The look in his eyes as he felt the keen edge and
  2767	glared at me was positively carnivorous.  I was afraid to turn my
  2768	shoulder to him, and when I left the galley I went out backwards—to the
  2769	amusement of the sailors and hunters, who made a point of gathering in
  2770	groups to witness my exit.  The strain was too great.  I sometimes
  2771	thought my mind would give way under it—a meet thing on this ship of
  2772	madmen and brutes.  Every hour, every minute of my existence was in
  2773	jeopardy.  I was a human soul in distress, and yet no soul, fore or aft,
  2774	betrayed sufficient sympathy to come to my aid.  At times I thought of
  2775	throwing myself on the mercy of Wolf Larsen, but the vision of the
  2776	mocking devil in his eyes that questioned life and sneered at it would
  2777	come strong upon me and compel me to refrain.  At other times I seriously
  2778	contemplated suicide, and the whole force of my hopeful philosophy was
  2779	required to keep me from going over the side in the darkness of night.
  2780	
  2781	Several times Wolf Larsen tried to inveigle me into discussion, but I
  2782	gave him short answers and eluded him.  Finally, he commanded me to
  2783	resume my seat at the cabin table for a time and let the cook do my work.
  2784	Then I spoke frankly, telling him what I was enduring from Thomas
  2785	Mugridge because of the three days of favouritism which had been shown
  2786	me.  Wolf Larsen regarded me with smiling eyes.
  2787	
  2788	“So you’re afraid, eh?” he sneered.
  2789	
  2790	“Yes,” I said defiantly and honestly, “I am afraid.”
  2791	
  2792	“That’s the way with you fellows,” he cried, half angrily,
  2793	“sentimentalizing about your immortal souls and afraid to die.  At sight
  2794	of a sharp knife and a cowardly Cockney the clinging of life to life
  2795	overcomes all your fond foolishness.  Why, my dear fellow, you will live
  2796	for ever.  You are a god, and God cannot be killed.  Cooky cannot hurt
  2797	you.  You are sure of your resurrection.  What’s there to be afraid of?
  2798	
  2799	“You have eternal life before you.  You are a millionaire in immortality,
  2800	and a millionaire whose fortune cannot be lost, whose fortune is less
  2801	perishable than the stars and as lasting as space or time.  It is
  2802	impossible for you to diminish your principal.  Immortality is a thing
  2803	without beginning or end.  Eternity is eternity, and though you die here
  2804	and now you will go on living somewhere else and hereafter.  And it is
  2805	all very beautiful, this shaking off of the flesh and soaring of the
  2806	imprisoned spirit.  Cooky cannot hurt you.  He can only give you a boost
  2807	on the path you eternally must tread.
  2808	
  2809	“Or, if you do not wish to be boosted just yet, why not boost Cooky?
  2810	According to your ideas, he, too, must be an immortal millionaire.  You
  2811	cannot bankrupt him.  His paper will always circulate at par.  You cannot
  2812	diminish the length of his living by killing him, for he is without
  2813	beginning or end.  He’s bound to go on living, somewhere, somehow.  Then
  2814	boost him.  Stick a knife in him and let his spirit free.  As it is, it’s
  2815	in a nasty prison, and you’ll do him only a kindness by breaking down the
  2816	door.  And who knows?—it may be a very beautiful spirit that will go
  2817	soaring up into the blue from that ugly carcass.  Boost him along, and
  2818	I’ll promote you to his place, and he’s getting forty-five dollars a
  2819	month.”
  2820	
  2821	It was plain that I could look for no help or mercy from Wolf Larsen.
  2822	Whatever was to be done I must do for myself; and out of the courage of
  2823	fear I evolved the plan of fighting Thomas Mugridge with his own weapons.
  2824	I borrowed a whetstone from Johansen.  Louis, the boat-steerer, had
  2825	already begged me for condensed milk and sugar.  The lazarette, where
  2826	such delicacies were stored, was situated beneath the cabin floor.
  2827	Watching my chance, I stole five cans of the milk, and that night, when
  2828	it was Louis’s watch on deck, I traded them with him for a dirk as lean
  2829	and cruel-looking as Thomas Mugridge’s vegetable knife.  It was rusty and
  2830	dull, but I turned the grindstone while Louis gave it an edge.  I slept
  2831	more soundly than usual that night.
  2832	
  2833	Next morning, after breakfast, Thomas Mugridge began his whet, whet,
  2834	whet.  I glanced warily at him, for I was on my knees taking the ashes
  2835	from the stove.  When I returned from throwing them overside, he was
  2836	talking to Harrison, whose honest yokel’s face was filled with
  2837	fascination and wonder.
  2838	
  2839	“Yes,” Mugridge was saying, “an’ wot does ’is worship do but give me two
  2840	years in Reading.  But blimey if I cared.  The other mug was fixed
  2841	plenty.  Should ’a seen ’im.  Knife just like this.  I stuck it in, like
  2842	into soft butter, an’ the w’y ’e squealed was better’n a tu-penny gaff.”
  2843	He shot a glance in my direction to see if I was taking it in, and went
  2844	on.  “‘I didn’t mean it Tommy,’ ’e was snifflin’; ‘so ’elp me Gawd, I
  2845	didn’t mean it!’  ‘I’ll fix yer bloody well right,’ I sez, an’ kept right
  2846	after ’im.  I cut ’im in ribbons, that’s wot I did, an’ ’e a-squealin’
  2847	all the time.  Once ’e got ’is ’and on the knife an’ tried to ’old it.
  2848	‘Ad ’is fingers around it, but I pulled it through, cuttin’ to the bone.
  2849	O, ’e was a sight, I can tell yer.”
  2850	
  2851	A call from the mate interrupted the gory narrative, and Harrison went
  2852	aft.  Mugridge sat down on the raised threshold to the galley and went on
  2853	with his knife-sharpening.  I put the shovel away and calmly sat down on
  2854	the coal-box facing him.  He favoured me with a vicious stare.  Still
  2855	calmly, though my heart was going pitapat, I pulled out Louis’s dirk and
  2856	began to whet it on the stone.  I had looked for almost any sort of
  2857	explosion on the Cockney’s part, but to my surprise he did not appear
  2858	aware of what I was doing.  He went on whetting his knife.  So did I.
  2859	And for two hours we sat there, face to face, whet, whet, whet, till the
  2860	news of it spread abroad and half the ship’s company was crowding the
  2861	galley doors to see the sight.
  2862	
  2863	Encouragement and advice were freely tendered, and Jock Horner, the
  2864	quiet, self-spoken hunter who looked as though he would not harm a mouse,
  2865	advised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust upward for the abdomen,
  2866	at the same time giving what he called the “Spanish twist” to the blade.
  2867	Leach, his bandaged arm prominently to the fore, begged me to leave a few
  2868	remnants of the cook for him; and Wolf Larsen paused once or twice at the
  2869	break of the poop to glance curiously at what must have been to him a
  2870	stirring and crawling of the yeasty thing he knew as life.
  2871	
  2872	And I make free to say that for the time being life assumed the same
  2873	sordid values to me.  There was nothing pretty about it, nothing
  2874	divine—only two cowardly moving things that sat whetting steel upon
  2875	stone, and a group of other moving things, cowardly and otherwise, that
  2876	looked on.  Half of them, I am sure, were anxious to see us shedding each
  2877	other’s blood.  It would have been entertainment.  And I do not think
  2878	there was one who would have interfered had we closed in a
  2879	death-struggle.
  2880	
  2881	On the other hand, the whole thing was laughable and childish.  Whet,
  2882	whet, whet,—Humphrey Van Weyden sharpening his knife in a ship’s galley
  2883	and trying its edge with his thumb!  Of all situations this was the most
  2884	inconceivable.  I know that my own kind could not have believed it
  2885	possible.  I had not been called “Sissy” Van Weyden all my days without
  2886	reason, and that “Sissy” Van Weyden should be capable of doing this thing
  2887	was a revelation to Humphrey Van Weyden, who knew not whether to be
  2888	exultant or ashamed.
  2889	
  2890	But nothing happened.  At the end of two hours Thomas Mugridge put away
  2891	knife and stone and held out his hand.
  2892	
  2893	“Wot’s the good of mykin’ a ’oly show of ourselves for them mugs?” he
  2894	demanded.  “They don’t love us, an’ bloody well glad they’d be a-seein’
  2895	us cuttin’ our throats.  Yer not ’arf bad, ’Ump!  You’ve got spunk, as
  2896	you Yanks s’y, an’ I like yer in a w’y.  So come on an’ shyke.”
  2897	
  2898	Coward that I might be, I was less a coward than he.  It was a distinct
  2899	victory I had gained, and I refused to forego any of it by shaking his
  2900	detestable hand.
  2901	
  2902	“All right,” he said pridelessly, “tyke it or leave it, I’ll like yer
  2903	none the less for it.”  And to save his face he turned fiercely upon the
  2904	onlookers.  “Get outa my galley-doors, you bloomin’ swabs!”
  2905	
  2906	This command was reinforced by a steaming kettle of water, and at sight
  2907	of it the sailors scrambled out of the way.  This was a sort of victory
  2908	for Thomas Mugridge, and enabled him to accept more gracefully the defeat
  2909	I had given him, though, of course, he was too discreet to attempt to
  2910	drive the hunters away.
  2911	
  2912	“I see Cooky’s finish,” I heard Smoke say to Horner.
  2913	
  2914	“You bet,” was the reply.  “Hump runs the galley from now on, and Cooky
  2915	pulls in his horns.”
  2916	
  2917	Mugridge heard and shot a swift glance at me, but I gave no sign that the
  2918	conversation had reached me.  I had not thought my victory was so
  2919	far-reaching and complete, but I resolved to let go nothing I had gained.
  2920	As the days went by, Smoke’s prophecy was verified.  The Cockney became
  2921	more humble and slavish to me than even to Wolf Larsen.  I mistered him
  2922	and sirred him no longer, washed no more greasy pots, and peeled no more
  2923	potatoes.  I did my own work, and my own work only, and when and in what
  2924	fashion I saw fit.  Also I carried the dirk in a sheath at my hip,
  2925	sailor-fashion, and maintained toward Thomas Mugridge a constant attitude
  2926	which was composed of equal parts of domineering, insult, and contempt.
  2927	
  2928	
  2929	
  2930	
  2931	CHAPTER X
  2932	
  2933	
  2934	My intimacy with Wolf Larsen increases—if by intimacy may be denoted
  2935	those relations which exist between master and man, or, better yet,
  2936	between king and jester.  I am to him no more than a toy, and he values
  2937	me no more than a child values a toy.  My function is to amuse, and so
  2938	long as I amuse all goes well; but let him become bored, or let him have
  2939	one of his black moods come upon him, and at once I am relegated from
  2940	cabin table to galley, while, at the same time, I am fortunate to escape
  2941	with my life and a whole body.
  2942	
  2943	The loneliness of the man is slowly being borne in upon me.  There is not
  2944	a man aboard but hates or fears him, nor is there a man whom he does not
  2945	despise.  He seems consuming with the tremendous power that is in him and
  2946	that seems never to have found adequate expression in works.  He is as
  2947	Lucifer would be, were that proud spirit banished to a society of
  2948	soulless, Tomlinsonian ghosts.
  2949	
  2950	This loneliness is bad enough in itself, but, to make it worse, he is
  2951	oppressed by the primal melancholy of the race.  Knowing him, I review
  2952	the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding.  The
  2953	white-skinned, fair-haired savages who created that terrible pantheon
  2954	were of the same fibre as he.  The frivolity of the laughter-loving
  2955	Latins is no part of him.  When he laughs it is from a humour that is
  2956	nothing else than ferocious.  But he laughs rarely; he is too often sad.
  2957	And it is a sadness as deep-reaching as the roots of the race.  It is the
  2958	race heritage, the sadness which has made the race sober-minded,
  2959	clean-lived and fanatically moral, and which, in this latter connection,
  2960	has culminated among the English in the Reformed Church and Mrs. Grundy.
  2961	
  2962	In point of fact, the chief vent to this primal melancholy has been
  2963	religion in its more agonizing forms.  But the compensations of such
  2964	religion are denied Wolf Larsen.  His brutal materialism will not permit
  2965	it.  So, when his blue moods come on, nothing remains for him, but to be
  2966	devilish.  Were he not so terrible a man, I could sometimes feel sorry
  2967	for him, as instance three mornings ago, when I went into his stateroom
  2968	to fill his water-bottle and came unexpectedly upon him.  He did not see
  2969	me.  His head was buried in his hands, and his shoulders were heaving
  2970	convulsively as with sobs.  He seemed torn by some mighty grief.  As I
  2971	softly withdrew I could hear him groaning, “God!  God!  God!”  Not that
  2972	he was calling upon God; it was a mere expletive, but it came from his
  2973	soul.
  2974	
  2975	At dinner he asked the hunters for a remedy for headache, and by evening,
  2976	strong man that he was, he was half-blind and reeling about the cabin.
  2977	
  2978	“I’ve never been sick in my life, Hump,” he said, as I guided him to his
  2979	room.  “Nor did I ever have a headache except the time my head was
  2980	healing after having been laid open for six inches by a capstan-bar.”
  2981	
  2982	For three days this blinding headache lasted, and he suffered as wild
  2983	animals suffer, as it seemed the way on ship to suffer, without plaint,
  2984	without sympathy, utterly alone.
  2985	
  2986	This morning, however, on entering his state-room to make the bed and put
  2987	things in order, I found him well and hard at work.  Table and bunk were
  2988	littered with designs and calculations.  On a large transparent sheet,
  2989	compass and square in hand, he was copying what appeared to be a scale of
  2990	some sort or other.
  2991	
  2992	“Hello, Hump,” he greeted me genially.  “I’m just finishing the finishing
  2993	touches.  Want to see it work?”
  2994	
  2995	“But what is it?” I asked.
  2996	
  2997	“A labour-saving device for mariners, navigation reduced to kindergarten
  2998	simplicity,” he answered gaily.  “From to-day a child will be able to
  2999	navigate a ship.  No more long-winded calculations.  All you need is one
  3000	star in the sky on a dirty night to know instantly where you are.  Look.
  3001	I place the transparent scale on this star-map, revolving the scale on
  3002	the North Pole.  On the scale I’ve worked out the circles of altitude and
  3003	the lines of bearing.  All I do is to put it on a star, revolve the scale
  3004	till it is opposite those figures on the map underneath, and presto!
  3005	there you are, the ship’s precise location!”
  3006	
  3007	There was a ring of triumph in his voice, and his eyes, clear blue this
  3008	morning as the sea, were sparkling with light.
  3009	
  3010	“You must be well up in mathematics,” I said.  “Where did you go to
  3011	school?”
  3012	
  3013	“Never saw the inside of one, worse luck,” was the answer.  “I had to dig
  3014	it out for myself.”
  3015	
  3016	“And why do you think I have made this thing?” he demanded, abruptly.
  3017	“Dreaming to leave footprints on the sands of time?”  He laughed one of
  3018	his horrible mocking laughs.  “Not at all.  To get it patented, to make
  3019	money from it, to revel in piggishness with all night in while other men
  3020	do the work.  That’s my purpose.  Also, I have enjoyed working it out.”
  3021	
  3022	“The creative joy,” I murmured.
  3023	
  3024	“I guess that’s what it ought to be called.  Which is another way of
  3025	expressing the joy of life in that it is alive, the triumph of movement
  3026	over matter, of the quick over the dead, the pride of the yeast because
  3027	it is yeast and crawls.”
  3028	
  3029	I threw up my hands with helpless disapproval of his inveterate
  3030	materialism and went about making the bed.  He continued copying lines
  3031	and figures upon the transparent scale.  It was a task requiring the
  3032	utmost nicety and precision, and I could not but admire the way he
  3033	tempered his strength to the fineness and delicacy of the need.
  3034	
  3035	When I had finished the bed, I caught myself looking at him in a
  3036	fascinated sort of way.  He was certainly a handsome man—beautiful in the
  3037	masculine sense.  And again, with never-failing wonder, I remarked the
  3038	total lack of viciousness, or wickedness, or sinfulness in his face.  It
  3039	was the face, I am convinced, of a man who did no wrong.  And by this I
  3040	do not wish to be misunderstood.  What I mean is that it was the face of
  3041	a man who either did nothing contrary to the dictates of his conscience,
  3042	or who had no conscience.  I am inclined to the latter way of accounting
  3043	for it.  He was a magnificent atavism, a man so purely primitive that he
  3044	was of the type that came into the world before the development of the
  3045	moral nature.  He was not immoral, but merely unmoral.
  3046	
  3047	As I have said, in the masculine sense his was a beautiful face.
  3048	Smooth-shaven, every line was distinct, and it was cut as clear and sharp
  3049	as a cameo; while sea and sun had tanned the naturally fair skin to a
  3050	dark bronze which bespoke struggle and battle and added both to his
  3051	savagery and his beauty.  The lips were full, yet possessed of the
  3052	firmness, almost harshness, which is characteristic of thin lips.  The
  3053	set of his mouth, his chin, his jaw, was likewise firm or harsh, with all
  3054	the fierceness and indomitableness of the male—the nose also.  It was the
  3055	nose of a being born to conquer and command.  It just hinted of the eagle
  3056	beak.  It might have been Grecian, it might have been Roman, only it was
  3057	a shade too massive for the one, a shade too delicate for the other.  And
  3058	while the whole face was the incarnation of fierceness and strength, the
  3059	primal melancholy from which he suffered seemed to greaten the lines of
  3060	mouth and eye and brow, seemed to give a largeness and completeness which
  3061	otherwise the face would have lacked.
  3062	
  3063	And so I caught myself standing idly and studying him.  I cannot say how
  3064	greatly the man had come to interest me.  Who was he?  What was he?  How
  3065	had he happened to be?  All powers seemed his, all potentialities—why,
  3066	then, was he no more than the obscure master of a seal-hunting schooner
  3067	with a reputation for frightful brutality amongst the men who hunted
  3068	seals?
  3069	
  3070	My curiosity burst from me in a flood of speech.
  3071	
  3072	“Why is it that you have not done great things in this world?  With the
  3073	power that is yours you might have risen to any height.  Unpossessed of
  3074	conscience or moral instinct, you might have mastered the world, broken
  3075	it to your hand.  And yet here you are, at the top of your life, where
  3076	diminishing and dying begin, living an obscure and sordid existence,
  3077	hunting sea animals for the satisfaction of woman’s vanity and love of
  3078	decoration, revelling in a piggishness, to use your own words, which is
  3079	anything and everything except splendid.  Why, with all that wonderful
  3080	strength, have you not done something?  There was nothing to stop you,
  3081	nothing that could stop you.  What was wrong?  Did you lack ambition?
  3082	Did you fall under temptation?  What was the matter?  What was the
  3083	matter?”
  3084	
  3085	He had lifted his eyes to me at the commencement of my outburst, and
  3086	followed me complacently until I had done and stood before him breathless
  3087	and dismayed.  He waited a moment, as though seeking where to begin, and
  3088	then said:
  3089	
  3090	“Hump, do you know the parable of the sower who went forth to sow?  If
  3091	you will remember, some of the seed fell upon stony places, where there
  3092	was not much earth, and forthwith they sprung up because they had no
  3093	deepness of earth.  And when the sun was up they were scorched, and
  3094	because they had no root they withered away.  And some fell among thorns,
  3095	and the thorns sprung up and choked them.”
  3096	
  3097	“Well?” I said.
  3098	
  3099	“Well?” he queried, half petulantly.  “It was not well.  I was one of
  3100	those seeds.”
  3101	
  3102	He dropped his head to the scale and resumed the copying.  I finished my
  3103	work and had opened the door to leave, when he spoke to me.
  3104	
  3105	“Hump, if you will look on the west coast of the map of Norway you will
  3106	see an indentation called Romsdal Fiord.  I was born within a hundred
  3107	miles of that stretch of water.  But I was not born Norwegian.  I am a
  3108	Dane.  My father and mother were Danes, and how they ever came to that
  3109	bleak bight of land on the west coast I do not know.  I never heard.
  3110	Outside of that there is nothing mysterious.  They were poor people and
  3111	unlettered.  They came of generations of poor unlettered people—peasants
  3112	of the sea who sowed their sons on the waves as has been their custom
  3113	since time began.  There is no more to tell.”
  3114	
  3115	“But there is,” I objected.  “It is still obscure to me.”
  3116	
  3117	“What can I tell you?” he demanded, with a recrudescence of fierceness.
  3118	“Of the meagreness of a child’s life? of fish diet and coarse living? of
  3119	going out with the boats from the time I could crawl? of my brothers, who
  3120	went away one by one to the deep-sea farming and never came back? of
  3121	myself, unable to read or write, cabin-boy at the mature age of ten on
  3122	the coastwise, old-country ships? of the rough fare and rougher usage,
  3123	where kicks and blows were bed and breakfast and took the place of
  3124	speech, and fear and hatred and pain were my only soul-experiences?  I do
  3125	not care to remember.  A madness comes up in my brain even now as I think
  3126	of it.  But there were coastwise skippers I would have returned and
  3127	killed when a man’s strength came to me, only the lines of my life were
  3128	cast at the time in other places.  I did return, not long ago, but
  3129	unfortunately the skippers were dead, all but one, a mate in the old
  3130	days, a skipper when I met him, and when I left him a cripple who would
  3131	never walk again.”
  3132	
  3133	“But you who read Spencer and Darwin and have never seen the inside of a
  3134	school, how did you learn to read and write?” I queried.
  3135	
  3136	“In the English merchant service.  Cabin-boy at twelve, ship’s boy at
  3137	fourteen, ordinary seamen at sixteen, able seaman at seventeen, and cock
  3138	of the fo’c’sle, infinite ambition and infinite loneliness, receiving
  3139	neither help nor sympathy, I did it all for myself—navigation,
  3140	mathematics, science, literature, and what not.  And of what use has it
  3141	been?  Master and owner of a ship at the top of my life, as you say, when
  3142	I am beginning to diminish and die.  Paltry, isn’t it?  And when the sun
  3143	was up I was scorched, and because I had no root I withered away.”
  3144	
  3145	“But history tells of slaves who rose to the purple,” I chided.
  3146	
  3147	“And history tells of opportunities that came to the slaves who rose to
  3148	the purple,” he answered grimly.  “No man makes opportunity.  All the
  3149	great men ever did was to know it when it came to them.  The Corsican
  3150	knew.  I have dreamed as greatly as the Corsican.  I should have known
  3151	the opportunity, but it never came.  The thorns sprung up and choked me.
  3152	And, Hump, I can tell you that you know more about me than any living
  3153	man, except my own brother.”
  3154	
  3155	“And what is he?  And where is he?”
  3156	
  3157	“Master of the steamship _Macedonia_, seal-hunter,” was the answer.  “We
  3158	will meet him most probably on the Japan coast.  Men call him ‘Death’
  3159	Larsen.”
  3160	
  3161	“Death Larsen!” I involuntarily cried.  “Is he like you?”
  3162	
  3163	“Hardly.  He is a lump of an animal without any head.  He has all my—my—”
  3164	
  3165	“Brutishness,” I suggested.
  3166	
  3167	“Yes,—thank you for the word,—all my brutishness, but he can scarcely
  3168	read or write.”
  3169	
  3170	“And he has never philosophized on life,” I added.
  3171	
  3172	“No,” Wolf Larsen answered, with an indescribable air of sadness.  “And
  3173	he is all the happier for leaving life alone.  He is too busy living it
  3174	to think about it.  My mistake was in ever opening the books.”
  3175	
  3176	
  3177	
  3178	
  3179	CHAPTER XI
  3180	
  3181	
  3182	The _Ghost_ has attained the southernmost point of the arc she is
  3183	describing across the Pacific, and is already beginning to edge away to
  3184	the west and north toward some lone island, it is rumoured, where she
  3185	will fill her water-casks before proceeding to the season’s hunt along
  3186	the coast of Japan.  The hunters have experimented and practised with
  3187	their rifles and shotguns till they are satisfied, and the boat-pullers
  3188	and steerers have made their spritsails, bound the oars and rowlocks in
  3189	leather and sennit so that they will make no noise when creeping on the
  3190	seals, and put their boats in apple-pie order—to use Leach’s homely
  3191	phrase.
  3192	
  3193	His arm, by the way, has healed nicely, though the scar will remain all
  3194	his life.  Thomas Mugridge lives in mortal fear of him, and is afraid to
  3195	venture on deck after dark.  There are two or three standing quarrels in
  3196	the forecastle.  Louis tells me that the gossip of the sailors finds its
  3197	way aft, and that two of the telltales have been badly beaten by their
  3198	mates.  He shakes his head dubiously over the outlook for the man
  3199	Johnson, who is boat-puller in the same boat with him.  Johnson has been
  3200	guilty of speaking his mind too freely, and has collided two or three
  3201	times with Wolf Larsen over the pronunciation of his name.  Johansen he
  3202	thrashed on the amidships deck the other night, since which time the mate
  3203	has called him by his proper name.  But of course it is out of the
  3204	question that Johnson should thrash Wolf Larsen.
  3205	
  3206	Louis has also given me additional information about Death Larsen, which
  3207	tallies with the captain’s brief description.  We may expect to meet
  3208	Death Larsen on the Japan coast.  “And look out for squalls,” is Louis’s
  3209	prophecy, “for they hate one another like the wolf whelps they are.”
  3210	Death Larsen is in command of the only sealing steamer in the fleet, the
  3211	_Macedonia_, which carries fourteen boats, whereas the rest of the
  3212	schooners carry only six.  There is wild talk of cannon aboard, and of
  3213	strange raids and expeditions she may make, ranging from opium smuggling
  3214	into the States and arms smuggling into China, to blackbirding and open
  3215	piracy.  Yet I cannot but believe for I have never yet caught him in a
  3216	lie, while he has a cyclopædic knowledge of sealing and the men of the
  3217	sealing fleets.
  3218	
  3219	As it is forward and in the galley, so it is in the steerage and aft, on
  3220	this veritable hell-ship.  Men fight and struggle ferociously for one
  3221	another’s lives.  The hunters are looking for a shooting scrape at any
  3222	moment between Smoke and Henderson, whose old quarrel has not healed,
  3223	while Wolf Larsen says positively that he will kill the survivor of the
  3224	affair, if such affair comes off.  He frankly states that the position he
  3225	takes is based on no moral grounds, that all the hunters could kill and
  3226	eat one another so far as he is concerned, were it not that he needs them
  3227	alive for the hunting.  If they will only hold their hands until the
  3228	season is over, he promises them a royal carnival, when all grudges can
  3229	he settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard and
  3230	arrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea.  I think even
  3231	the hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness.  Wicked men though they
  3232	be, they are certainly very much afraid of him.
  3233	
  3234	Thomas Mugridge is cur-like in his subjection to me, while I go about in
  3235	secret dread of him.  His is the courage of fear,—a strange thing I know
  3236	well of myself,—and at any moment it may master the fear and impel him to
  3237	the taking of my life.  My knee is much better, though it often aches for
  3238	long periods, and the stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf
  3239	Larsen squeezed.  Otherwise I am in splendid condition, feel that I am in
  3240	splendid condition.  My muscles are growing harder and increasing in
  3241	size.  My hands, however, are a spectacle for grief.  They have a
  3242	parboiled appearance, are afflicted with hang-nails, while the nails are
  3243	broken and discoloured, and the edges of the quick seem to be assuming a
  3244	fungoid sort of growth.  Also, I am suffering from boils, due to the
  3245	diet, most likely, for I was never afflicted in this manner before.
  3246	
  3247	I was amused, a couple of evenings back, by seeing Wolf Larsen reading
  3248	the Bible, a copy of which, after the futile search for one at the
  3249	beginning of the voyage, had been found in the dead mate’s sea-chest.  I
  3250	wondered what Wolf Larsen could get from it, and he read aloud to me from
  3251	Ecclesiastes.  I could imagine he was speaking the thoughts of his own
  3252	mind as he read to me, and his voice, reverberating deeply and mournfully
  3253	in the confined cabin, charmed and held me.  He may be uneducated, but he
  3254	certainly knows how to express the significance of the written word.  I
  3255	can hear him now, as I shall always hear him, the primal melancholy
  3256	vibrant in his voice as he read:
  3257	
  3258	    “I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of
  3259	    kings and of the provinces; I gat me men singers and women singers,
  3260	    and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that
  3261	    of all sorts.
  3262	
  3263	    “So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
  3264	    Jerusalem; also my wisdom returned with me.
  3265	
  3266	    “Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the
  3267	    labour that I had laboured to do; and behold, all was vanity and
  3268	    vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
  3269	
  3270	    “All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous
  3271	    and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean;
  3272	    to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not; as is the
  3273	    good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an
  3274	    oath.
  3275	
  3276	    “This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that
  3277	    there is one event unto all; yea, also the heart of the sons of men
  3278	    is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and
  3279	    after that they go to the dead.
  3280	
  3281	    “For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope; for a
  3282	    living dog is better than a dead lion.
  3283	
  3284	    “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not
  3285	    anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them
  3286	    is forgotten.
  3287	
  3288	    “Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
  3289	    neither have they any more a portion for ever in anything that is
  3290	    done under the sun.”
  3291	
  3292	“There you have it, Hump,” he said, closing the book upon his finger and
  3293	looking up at me.  “The Preacher who was king over Israel in Jerusalem
  3294	thought as I think.  You call me a pessimist.  Is not this pessimism of
  3295	the blackest?—‘All is vanity and vexation of spirit,’ ‘There is no profit
  3296	under the sun,’ ‘There is one event unto all,’ to the fool and the wise,
  3297	the clean and the unclean, the sinner and the saint, and that event is
  3298	death, and an evil thing, he says.  For the Preacher loved life, and did
  3299	not want to die, saying, ‘For a living dog is better than a dead lion.’
  3300	He preferred the vanity and vexation to the silence and unmovableness of
  3301	the grave.  And so I.  To crawl is piggish; but to not crawl, to be as
  3302	the clod and rock, is loathsome to contemplate.  It is loathsome to the
  3303	life that is in me, the very essence of which is movement, the power of
  3304	movement, and the consciousness of the power of movement.  Life itself is
  3305	unsatisfaction, but to look ahead to death is greater unsatisfaction.”
  3306	
  3307	“You are worse off than Omar,” I said.  “He, at least, after the
  3308	customary agonizing of youth, found content and made of his materialism a
  3309	joyous thing.”
  3310	
  3311	“Who was Omar?” Wolf Larsen asked, and I did no more work that day, nor
  3312	the next, nor the next.
  3313	
  3314	In his random reading he had never chanced upon the Rubáiyát, and it was
  3315	to him like a great find of treasure.  Much I remembered, possibly
  3316	two-thirds of the quatrains, and I managed to piece out the remainder
  3317	without difficulty.  We talked for hours over single stanzas, and I found
  3318	him reading into them a wail of regret and a rebellion which, for the
  3319	life of me, I could not discover myself.  Possibly I recited with a
  3320	certain joyous lilt which was my own, for—his memory was good, and at a
  3321	second rendering, very often the first, he made a quatrain his own—he
  3322	recited the same lines and invested them with an unrest and passionate
  3323	revolt that was well-nigh convincing.
  3324	
  3325	I was interested as to which quatrain he would like best, and was not
  3326	surprised when he hit upon the one born of an instant’s irritability, and
  3327	quite at variance with the Persian’s complacent philosophy and genial
  3328	code of life:
  3329	
  3330	   “What, without asking, hither hurried _Whence_?
  3331	   And, without asking, _Whither_ hurried hence!
  3332	      Oh, many a Cup of this forbidden Wine
  3333	   Must drown the memory of that insolence!”
  3334	
  3335	“Great!” Wolf Larsen cried.  “Great!  That’s the keynote.  Insolence!  He
  3336	could not have used a better word.”
  3337	
  3338	In vain I objected and denied.  He deluged me, overwhelmed me with
  3339	argument.
  3340	
  3341	“It’s not the nature of life to be otherwise.  Life, when it knows that
  3342	it must cease living, will always rebel.  It cannot help itself.  The
  3343	Preacher found life and the works of life all a vanity and vexation, an
  3344	evil thing; but death, the ceasing to be able to be vain and vexed, he
  3345	found an eviler thing.  Through chapter after chapter he is worried by
  3346	the one event that cometh to all alike.  So Omar, so I, so you, even you,
  3347	for you rebelled against dying when Cooky sharpened a knife for you.  You
  3348	were afraid to die; the life that was in you, that composes you, that is
  3349	greater than you, did not want to die.  You have talked of the instinct
  3350	of immortality.  I talk of the instinct of life, which is to live, and
  3351	which, when death looms near and large, masters the instinct, so called,
  3352	of immortality.  It mastered it in you (you cannot deny it), because a
  3353	crazy Cockney cook sharpened a knife.
  3354	
  3355	“You are afraid of him now.  You are afraid of me.  You cannot deny it.
  3356	If I should catch you by the throat, thus,”—his hand was about my throat
  3357	and my breath was shut off,—“and began to press the life out of you thus,
  3358	and thus, your instinct of immortality will go glimmering, and your
  3359	instinct of life, which is longing for life, will flutter up, and you
  3360	will struggle to save yourself.  Eh?  I see the fear of death in your
  3361	eyes.  You beat the air with your arms.  You exert all your puny strength
  3362	to struggle to live.  Your hand is clutching my arm, lightly it feels as
  3363	a butterfly resting there.  Your chest is heaving, your tongue
  3364	protruding, your skin turning dark, your eyes swimming.  ‘To live!  To
  3365	live!  To live!’ you are crying; and you are crying to live here and now,
  3366	not hereafter.  You doubt your immortality, eh?  Ha! ha!  You are not
  3367	sure of it.  You won’t chance it.  This life only you are certain is
  3368	real.  Ah, it is growing dark and darker.  It is the darkness of death,
  3369	the ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, the ceasing to move, that is
  3370	gathering about you, descending upon you, rising around you.  Your eyes
  3371	are becoming set.  They are glazing.  My voice sounds faint and far.  You
  3372	cannot see my face.  And still you struggle in my grip.  You kick with
  3373	your legs.  Your body draws itself up in knots like a snake’s.  Your
  3374	chest heaves and strains.  To live!  To live!  To live—”
  3375	
  3376	I heard no more.  Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness he had so
  3377	graphically described, and when I came to myself I was lying on the floor
  3378	and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old
  3379	familiar light of curiosity in his eyes.
  3380	
  3381	“Well, have I convinced you?” he demanded.  “Here take a drink of this.
  3382	I want to ask you some questions.”
  3383	
  3384	I rolled my head negatively on the floor.  “Your arguments are
  3385	too—er—forcible,” I managed to articulate, at cost of great pain to my
  3386	aching throat.
  3387	
  3388	“You’ll be all right in half-an-hour,” he assured me.  “And I promise I
  3389	won’t use any more physical demonstrations.  Get up now.  You can sit on
  3390	a chair.”
  3391	
  3392	And, toy that I was of this monster, the discussion of Omar and the
  3393	Preacher was resumed.  And half the night we sat up over it.
  3394	
  3395	
  3396	
  3397	
  3398	CHAPTER XII
  3399	
  3400	
  3401	The last twenty-four hours have witnessed a carnival of brutality.  From
  3402	cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion.  I
  3403	scarcely know where to begin.  Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it.
  3404	The relations among the men, strained and made tense by feuds, quarrels
  3405	and grudges, were in a state of unstable equilibrium, and evil passions
  3406	flared up in flame like prairie-grass.
  3407	
  3408	Thomas Mugridge is a sneak, a spy, an informer.  He has been attempting
  3409	to curry favour and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain
  3410	by carrying tales of the men forward.  He it was, I know, that carried
  3411	some of Johnson’s hasty talk to Wolf Larsen.  Johnson, it seems, bought a
  3412	suit of oilskins from the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly
  3413	inferior quality.  Nor was he slow in advertising the fact.  The
  3414	slop-chest is a sort of miniature dry-goods store which is carried by all
  3415	sealing schooners and which is stocked with articles peculiar to the
  3416	needs of the sailors.  Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his
  3417	subsequent earnings on the sealing grounds; for, as it is with the
  3418	hunters so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers—in the place of wages
  3419	they receive a “lay,” a rate of so much per skin for every skin captured
  3420	in their particular boat.
  3421	
  3422	But of Johnson’s grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing, so that what
  3423	I witnessed came with a shock of sudden surprise.  I had just finished
  3424	sweeping the cabin, and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a
  3425	discussion of Hamlet, his favourite Shakespearian character, when
  3426	Johansen descended the companion stairs followed by Johnson.  The
  3427	latter’s cap came off after the custom of the sea, and he stood
  3428	respectfully in the centre of the cabin, swaying heavily and uneasily to
  3429	the roll of the schooner and facing the captain.
  3430	
  3431	“Shut the doors and draw the slide,” Wolf Larsen said to me.
  3432	
  3433	As I obeyed I noticed an anxious light come into Johnson’s eyes, but I
  3434	did not dream of its cause.  I did not dream of what was to occur until
  3435	it did occur, but he knew from the very first what was coming and awaited
  3436	it bravely.  And in his action I found complete refutation of all Wolf
  3437	Larsen’s materialism.  The sailor Johnson was swayed by idea, by
  3438	principle, and truth, and sincerity.  He was right, he knew he was right,
  3439	and he was unafraid.  He would die for the right if needs be, he would be
  3440	true to himself, sincere with his soul.  And in this was portrayed the
  3441	victory of the spirit over the flesh, the indomitability and moral
  3442	grandeur of the soul that knows no restriction and rises above time and
  3443	space and matter with a surety and invincibleness born of nothing else
  3444	than eternity and immortality.
  3445	
  3446	But to return.  I noticed the anxious light in Johnson’s eyes, but
  3447	mistook it for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man.  The
  3448	mate, Johansen, stood away several feet to the side of him, and fully
  3449	three yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the pivotal cabin
  3450	chairs.  An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the doors and drawn
  3451	the slide, a pause that must have lasted fully a minute.  It was broken
  3452	by Wolf Larsen.
  3453	
  3454	“Yonson,” he began.
  3455	
  3456	“My name is Johnson, sir,” the sailor boldly corrected.
  3457	
  3458	“Well, Johnson, then, damn you!  Can you guess why I have sent for you?”
  3459	
  3460	“Yes, and no, sir,” was the slow reply.  “My work is done well.  The mate
  3461	knows that, and you know it, sir.  So there cannot be any complaint.”
  3462	
  3463	“And is that all?” Wolf Larsen queried, his voice soft, and low, and
  3464	purring.
  3465	
  3466	“I know you have it in for me,” Johnson continued with his unalterable
  3467	and ponderous slowness.  “You do not like me.  You—you—”
  3468	
  3469	“Go on,” Wolf Larsen prompted.  “Don’t be afraid of my feelings.”
  3470	
  3471	“I am not afraid,” the sailor retorted, a slight angry flush rising
  3472	through his sunburn.  “If I speak not fast, it is because I have not been
  3473	from the old country as long as you.  You do not like me because I am too
  3474	much of a man; that is why, sir.”
  3475	
  3476	“You are too much of a man for ship discipline, if that is what you mean,
  3477	and if you know what I mean,” was Wolf Larsen’s retort.
  3478	
  3479	“I know English, and I know what you mean, sir,” Johnson answered, his
  3480	flush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English language.
  3481	
  3482	“Johnson,” Wolf Larsen said, with an air of dismissing all that had gone
  3483	before as introductory to the main business in hand, “I understand you’re
  3484	not quite satisfied with those oilskins?”
  3485	
  3486	“No, I am not.  They are no good, sir.”
  3487	
  3488	“And you’ve been shooting off your mouth about them.”
  3489	
  3490	“I say what I think, sir,” the sailor answered courageously, not failing
  3491	at the same time in ship courtesy, which demanded that “sir” be appended
  3492	to each speech he made.
  3493	
  3494	It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Johansen.  His big
  3495	fists were clenching and unclenching, and his face was positively
  3496	fiendish, so malignantly did he look at Johnson.  I noticed a black
  3497	discoloration, still faintly visible, under Johansen’s eye, a mark of the
  3498	thrashing he had received a few nights before from the sailor.  For the
  3499	first time I began to divine that something terrible was about to be
  3500	enacted,—what, I could not imagine.
  3501	
  3502	“Do you know what happens to men who say what you’ve said about my
  3503	slop-chest and me?” Wolf Larsen was demanding.
  3504	
  3505	“I know, sir,” was the answer.
  3506	
  3507	“What?” Wolf Larsen demanded, sharply and imperatively.
  3508	
  3509	“What you and the mate there are going to do to me, sir.”
  3510	
  3511	“Look at him, Hump,” Wolf Larsen said to me, “look at this bit of
  3512	animated dust, this aggregation of matter that moves and breathes and
  3513	defies me and thoroughly believes itself to be compounded of something
  3514	good; that is impressed with certain human fictions such as righteousness
  3515	and honesty, and that will live up to them in spite of all personal
  3516	discomforts and menaces.  What do you think of him, Hump?  What do you
  3517	think of him?”
  3518	
  3519	“I think that he is a better man than you are,” I answered, impelled,
  3520	somehow, with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath I felt
  3521	was about to break upon his head.  “His human fictions, as you choose to
  3522	call them, make for nobility and manhood.  You have no fictions, no
  3523	dreams, no ideals.  You are a pauper.”
  3524	
  3525	He nodded his head with a savage pleasantness.  “Quite true, Hump, quite
  3526	true.  I have no fictions that make for nobility and manhood.  A living
  3527	dog is better than a dead lion, say I with the Preacher.  My only
  3528	doctrine is the doctrine of expediency, and it makes for surviving.  This
  3529	bit of the ferment we call ‘Johnson,’ when he is no longer a bit of the
  3530	ferment, only dust and ashes, will have no more nobility than any dust
  3531	and ashes, while I shall still be alive and roaring.”
  3532	
  3533	“Do you know what I am going to do?” he questioned.
  3534	
  3535	I shook my head.
  3536	
  3537	“Well, I am going to exercise my prerogative of roaring and show you how
  3538	fares nobility.  Watch me.”
  3539	
  3540	Three yards away from Johnson he was, and sitting down.  Nine feet!  And
  3541	yet he left the chair in full leap, without first gaining a standing
  3542	position.  He left the chair, just as he sat in it, squarely, springing
  3543	from the sitting posture like a wild animal, a tiger, and like a tiger
  3544	covered the intervening space.  It was an avalanche of fury that Johnson
  3545	strove vainly to fend off.  He threw one arm down to protect the stomach,
  3546	the other arm up to protect the head; but Wolf Larsen’s fist drove midway
  3547	between, on the chest, with a crushing, resounding impact.  Johnson’s
  3548	breath, suddenly expelled, shot from his mouth and as suddenly checked,
  3549	with the forced, audible expiration of a man wielding an axe.  He almost
  3550	fell backward, and swayed from side to side in an effort to recover his
  3551	balance.
  3552	
  3553	I cannot give the further particulars of the horrible scene that
  3554	followed.  It was too revolting.  It turns me sick even now when I think
  3555	of it.  Johnson fought bravely enough, but he was no match for Wolf
  3556	Larsen, much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate.  It was frightful.  I had
  3557	not imagined a human being could endure so much and still live and
  3558	struggle on.  And struggle on Johnson did.  Of course there was no hope
  3559	for him, not the slightest, and he knew it as well as I, but by the
  3560	manhood that was in him he could not cease from fighting for that
  3561	manhood.
  3562	
  3563	It was too much for me to witness.  I felt that I should lose my mind,
  3564	and I ran up the companion stairs to open the doors and escape on deck.
  3565	But Wolf Larsen, leaving his victim for the moment, and with one of his
  3566	tremendous springs, gained my side and flung me into the far corner of
  3567	the cabin.
  3568	
  3569	“The phenomena of life, Hump,” he girded at me.  “Stay and watch it.  You
  3570	may gather data on the immortality of the soul.  Besides, you know, we
  3571	can’t hurt Johnson’s soul.  It’s only the fleeting form we may demolish.”
  3572	
  3573	It seemed centuries—possibly it was no more than ten minutes that the
  3574	beating continued.  Wolf Larsen and Johansen were all about the poor
  3575	fellow.  They struck him with their fists, kicked him with their heavy
  3576	shoes, knocked him down, and dragged him to his feet to knock him down
  3577	again.  His eyes were blinded so that he could not see, and the blood
  3578	running from ears and nose and mouth turned the cabin into a shambles.
  3579	And when he could no longer rise they still continued to beat and kick
  3580	him where he lay.
  3581	
  3582	“Easy, Johansen; easy as she goes,” Wolf Larsen finally said.
  3583	
  3584	But the beast in the mate was up and rampant, and Wolf Larsen was
  3585	compelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the arm, gentle
  3586	enough, apparently, but which hurled Johansen back like a cork, driving
  3587	his head against the wall with a crash.  He fell to the floor, half
  3588	stunned for the moment, breathing heavily and blinking his eyes in a
  3589	stupid sort of way.
  3590	
  3591	“Jerk open the doors,—Hump,” I was commanded.
  3592	
  3593	I obeyed, and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like a sack of
  3594	rubbish and hove him clear up the companion stairs, through the narrow
  3595	doorway, and out on deck.  The blood from his nose gushed in a scarlet
  3596	stream over the feet of the helmsman, who was none other than Louis, his
  3597	boat-mate.  But Louis took and gave a spoke and gazed imperturbably into
  3598	the binnacle.
  3599	
  3600	Not so was the conduct of George Leach, the erstwhile cabin-boy.  Fore
  3601	and aft there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his
  3602	consequent behaviour.  He it was that came up on the poop without orders
  3603	and dragged Johnson forward, where he set about dressing his wounds as
  3604	well as he could and making him comfortable.  Johnson, as Johnson, was
  3605	unrecognizable; and not only that, for his features, as human features at
  3606	all, were unrecognizable, so discoloured and swollen had they become in
  3607	the few minutes which had elapsed between the beginning of the beating
  3608	and the dragging forward of the body.
  3609	
  3610	But of Leach’s behaviour—By the time I had finished cleansing the cabin
  3611	he had taken care of Johnson.  I had come up on deck for a breath of
  3612	fresh air and to try to get some repose for my overwrought nerves.  Wolf
  3613	Larsen was smoking a cigar and examining the patent log which the _Ghost_
  3614	usually towed astern, but which had been hauled in for some purpose.
  3615	Suddenly Leach’s voice came to my ears.  It was tense and hoarse with an
  3616	overmastering rage.  I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break
  3617	of the poop on the port side of the galley.  His face was convulsed and
  3618	white, his eyes were flashing, his clenched fists raised overhead.
  3619	
  3620	“May God damn your soul to hell, Wolf Larsen, only hell’s too good for
  3621	you, you coward, you murderer, you pig!” was his opening salutation.
  3622	
  3623	I was thunderstruck.  I looked for his instant annihilation.  But it was
  3624	not Wolf Larsen’s whim to annihilate him.  He sauntered slowly forward to
  3625	the break of the poop, and, leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin,
  3626	gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy.
  3627	
  3628	And the boy indicted Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted before.
  3629	The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle
  3630	scuttle and watched and listened.  The hunters piled pell-mell out of the
  3631	steerage, but as Leach’s tirade continued I saw that there was no levity
  3632	in their faces.  Even they were frightened, not at the boy’s terrible
  3633	words, but at his terrible audacity.  It did not seem possible that any
  3634	living creature could thus beard Wolf Larsen in his teeth.  I know for
  3635	myself that I was shocked into admiration of the boy, and I saw in him
  3636	the splendid invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the
  3637	fears of the flesh, as in the prophets of old, to condemn
  3638	unrighteousness.
  3639	
  3640	And such condemnation!  He haled forth Wolf Larsen’s soul naked to the
  3641	scorn of men.  He rained upon it curses from God and High Heaven, and
  3642	withered it with a heat of invective that savoured of a mediæval
  3643	excommunication of the Catholic Church.  He ran the gamut of
  3644	denunciation, rising to heights of wrath that were sublime and almost
  3645	Godlike, and from sheer exhaustion sinking to the vilest and most
  3646	indecent abuse.
  3647	
  3648	His rage was a madness.  His lips were flecked with a soapy froth, and
  3649	sometimes he choked and gurgled and became inarticulate.  And through it
  3650	all, calm and impassive, leaning on his elbow and gazing down, Wolf
  3651	Larsen seemed lost in a great curiosity.  This wild stirring of yeasty
  3652	life, this terrific revolt and defiance of matter that moved, perplexed
  3653	and interested him.
  3654	
  3655	Each moment I looked, and everybody looked, for him to leap upon the boy
  3656	and destroy him.  But it was not his whim.  His cigar went out, and he
  3657	continued to gaze silently and curiously.
  3658	
  3659	Leach had worked himself into an ecstasy of impotent rage.
  3660	
  3661	“Pig!  Pig!  Pig!” he was reiterating at the top of his lungs.  “Why
  3662	don’t you come down and kill me, you murderer?  You can do it!  I ain’t
  3663	afraid!  There’s no one to stop you!  Damn sight better dead and outa
  3664	your reach than alive and in your clutches!  Come on, you coward!  Kill
  3665	me!  Kill me!  Kill me!”
  3666	
  3667	It was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge’s erratic soul brought him into
  3668	the scene.  He had been listening at the galley door, but he now came
  3669	out, ostensibly to fling some scraps over the side, but obviously to see
  3670	the killing he was certain would take place.  He smirked greasily up into
  3671	the face of Wolf Larsen, who seemed not to see him.  But the Cockney was
  3672	unabashed, though mad, stark mad.  He turned to Leach, saying:
  3673	
  3674	“Such langwidge!  Shockin’!”
  3675	
  3676	Leach’s rage was no longer impotent.  Here at last was something ready to
  3677	hand.  And for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney had appeared
  3678	outside the galley without his knife.  The words had barely left his
  3679	mouth when he was knocked down by Leach.  Three times he struggled to his
  3680	feet, striving to gain the galley, and each time was knocked down.
  3681	
  3682	“Oh, Lord!” he cried.  “’Elp!  ’Elp!  Tyke ’im aw’y, carn’t yer?  Tyke
  3683	’im aw’y!”
  3684	
  3685	The hunters laughed from sheer relief.  Tragedy had dwindled, the farce
  3686	had begun.  The sailors now crowded boldly aft, grinning and shuffling,
  3687	to watch the pummelling of the hated Cockney.  And even I felt a great
  3688	joy surge up within me.  I confess that I delighted in this beating Leach
  3689	was giving to Thomas Mugridge, though it was as terrible, almost, as the
  3690	one Mugridge had caused to be given to Johnson.  But the expression of
  3691	Wolf Larsen’s face never changed.  He did not change his position either,
  3692	but continued to gaze down with a great curiosity.  For all his pragmatic
  3693	certitude, it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in
  3694	the hope of discovering something more about it, of discerning in its
  3695	maddest writhings a something which had hitherto escaped him,—the key to
  3696	its mystery, as it were, which would make all clear and plain.
  3697	
  3698	But the beating!  It was quite similar to the one I had witnessed in the
  3699	cabin.  The Cockney strove in vain to protect himself from the infuriated
  3700	boy.  And in vain he strove to gain the shelter of the cabin.  He rolled
  3701	toward it, grovelled toward it, fell toward it when he was knocked down.
  3702	But blow followed blow with bewildering rapidity.  He was knocked about
  3703	like a shuttlecock, until, finally, like Johnson, he was beaten and
  3704	kicked as he lay helpless on the deck.  And no one interfered.  Leach
  3705	could have killed him, but, having evidently filled the measure of his
  3706	vengeance, he drew away from his prostrate foe, who was whimpering and
  3707	wailing in a puppyish sort of way, and walked forward.
  3708	
  3709	But these two affairs were only the opening events of the day’s
  3710	programme.  In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each other,
  3711	and a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage, followed by a
  3712	stampede of the other four hunters for the deck.  A column of thick,
  3713	acrid smoke—the kind always made by black powder—was arising through the
  3714	open companion-way, and down through it leaped Wolf Larsen.  The sound of
  3715	blows and scuffling came to our ears.  Both men were wounded, and he was
  3716	thrashing them both for having disobeyed his orders and crippled
  3717	themselves in advance of the hunting season.  In fact, they were badly
  3718	wounded, and, having thrashed them, he proceeded to operate upon them in
  3719	a rough surgical fashion and to dress their wounds.  I served as
  3720	assistant while he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets,
  3721	and I saw the two men endure his crude surgery without anæsthetics and
  3722	with no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whisky.
  3723	
  3724	Then, in the first dog-watch, trouble came to a head in the forecastle.
  3725	It took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing which had been
  3726	the cause of Johnson’s beating, and from the noise we heard, and from the
  3727	sight of the bruised men next day, it was patent that half the forecastle
  3728	had soundly drubbed the other half.
  3729	
  3730	The second dog-watch and the day were wound up by a fight between
  3731	Johansen and the lean, Yankee-looking hunter, Latimer.  It was caused by
  3732	remarks of Latimer’s concerning the noises made by the mate in his sleep,
  3733	and though Johansen was whipped, he kept the steerage awake for the rest
  3734	of the night while he blissfully slumbered and fought the fight over and
  3735	over again.
  3736	
  3737	As for myself, I was oppressed with nightmare.  The day had been like
  3738	some horrible dream.  Brutality had followed brutality, and flaming
  3739	passions and cold-blooded cruelty had driven men to seek one another’s
  3740	lives, and to strive to hurt, and maim, and destroy.  My nerves were
  3741	shocked.  My mind itself was shocked.  All my days had been passed in
  3742	comparative ignorance of the animality of man.  In fact, I had known life
  3743	only in its intellectual phases.  Brutality I had experienced, but it was
  3744	the brutality of the intellect—the cutting sarcasm of Charley Furuseth,
  3745	the cruel epigrams and occasional harsh witticisms of the fellows at the
  3746	Bibelot, and the nasty remarks of some of the professors during my
  3747	undergraduate days.
  3748	
  3749	That was all.  But that men should wreak their anger on others by the
  3750	bruising of the flesh and the letting of blood was something strangely
  3751	and fearfully new to me.  Not for nothing had I been called “Sissy” Van
  3752	Weyden, I thought, as I tossed restlessly on my bunk between one
  3753	nightmare and another.  And it seemed to me that my innocence of the
  3754	realities of life had been complete indeed.  I laughed bitterly to
  3755	myself, and seemed to find in Wolf Larsen’s forbidding philosophy a more
  3756	adequate explanation of life than I found in my own.
  3757	
  3758	And I was frightened when I became conscious of the trend of my thought.
  3759	The continual brutality around me was degenerative in its effect.  It bid
  3760	fair to destroy for me all that was best and brightest in life.  My
  3761	reason dictated that the beating Thomas Mugridge had received was an ill
  3762	thing, and yet for the life of me I could not prevent my soul joying in
  3763	it.  And even while I was oppressed by the enormity of my sin,—for sin it
  3764	was,—I chuckled with an insane delight.  I was no longer Humphrey Van
  3765	Weyden.  I was Hump, cabin-boy on the schooner _Ghost_.  Wolf Larsen was
  3766	my captain, Thomas Mugridge and the rest were my companions, and I was
  3767	receiving repeated impresses from the die which had stamped them all.
  3768	
  3769	
  3770	
  3771	
  3772	CHAPTER XIII
  3773	
  3774	
  3775	For three days I did my own work and Thomas Mugridge’s too; and I flatter
  3776	myself that I did his work well.  I know that it won Wolf Larsen’s
  3777	approval, while the sailors beamed with satisfaction during the brief
  3778	time my _régime_ lasted.
  3779	
  3780	“The first clean bite since I come aboard,” Harrison said to me at the
  3781	galley door, as he returned the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle.
  3782	“Somehow Tommy’s grub always tastes of grease, stale grease, and I reckon
  3783	he ain’t changed his shirt since he left ’Frisco.”
  3784	
  3785	“I know he hasn’t,” I answered.
  3786	
  3787	“And I’ll bet he sleeps in it,” Harrison added.
  3788	
  3789	“And you won’t lose,” I agreed.  “The same shirt, and he hasn’t had it
  3790	off once in all this time.”
  3791	
  3792	But three days was all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to recover from
  3793	the effects of the beating.  On the fourth day, lame and sore, scarcely
  3794	able to see, so closed were his eyes, he was haled from his bunk by the
  3795	nape of the neck and set to his duty.  He sniffled and wept, but Wolf
  3796	Larsen was pitiless.
  3797	
  3798	“And see that you serve no more slops,” was his parting injunction.  “No
  3799	more grease and dirt, mind, and a clean shirt occasionally, or you’ll get
  3800	a tow over the side.  Understand?”
  3801	
  3802	Thomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor, and a short lurch
  3803	of the _Ghost_ sent him staggering.  In attempting to recover himself, he
  3804	reached for the iron railing which surrounded the stove and kept the pots
  3805	from sliding off; but he missed the railing, and his hand, with his
  3806	weight behind it, landed squarely on the hot surface.  There was a sizzle
  3807	and odour of burning flesh, and a sharp cry of pain.
  3808	
  3809	“Oh, Gawd, Gawd, wot ’ave I done?” he wailed; sitting down in the
  3810	coal-box and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth.  “W’y ’as
  3811	all this come on me?  It mykes me fair sick, it does, an’ I try so ’ard
  3812	to go through life ’armless an’ ’urtin’ nobody.”
  3813	
  3814	The tears were running down his puffed and discoloured cheeks, and his
  3815	face was drawn with pain.  A savage expression flitted across it.
  3816	
  3817	“Oh, ’ow I ’ate ’im!  ’Ow I ’ate ’im!” he gritted out.
  3818	
  3819	“Whom?” I asked; but the poor wretch was weeping again over his
  3820	misfortunes.  Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated than whom he
  3821	did not hate.  For I had come to see a malignant devil in him which
  3822	impelled him to hate all the world.  I sometimes thought that he hated
  3823	even himself, so grotesquely had life dealt with him, and so monstrously.
  3824	At such moments a great sympathy welled up within me, and I felt shame
  3825	that I had ever joyed in his discomfiture or pain.  Life had been unfair
  3826	to him.  It had played him a scurvy trick when it fashioned him into the
  3827	thing he was, and it had played him scurvy tricks ever since.  What
  3828	chance had he to be anything else than he was?  And as though answering
  3829	my unspoken thought, he wailed:
  3830	
  3831	“I never ’ad no chance, not ’arf a chance!  ’Oo was there to send me to
  3832	school, or put tommy in my ’ungry belly, or wipe my bloody nose for me,
  3833	w’en I was a kiddy?  ’Oo ever did anything for me, heh?  ’Oo, I s’y?”
  3834	
  3835	“Never mind, Tommy,” I said, placing a soothing hand on his shoulder.
  3836	“Cheer up.  It’ll all come right in the end.  You’ve long years before
  3837	you, and you can make anything you please of yourself.”
  3838	
  3839	“It’s a lie! a bloody lie!” he shouted in my face, flinging off the hand.
  3840	“It’s a lie, and you know it.  I’m already myde, an’ myde out of leavin’s
  3841	an’ scraps.  It’s all right for you, ’Ump.  You was born a gentleman.
  3842	You never knew wot it was to go ’ungry, to cry yerself asleep with yer
  3843	little belly gnawin’ an’ gnawin’, like a rat inside yer.  It carn’t come
  3844	right.  If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer, ’ow would it
  3845	fill my belly for one time w’en I was a kiddy and it went empty?
  3846	
  3847	“’Ow could it, I s’y?  I was born to sufferin’ and sorrer.  I’ve had more
  3848	cruel sufferin’ than any ten men, I ’ave.  I’ve been in orspital arf my
  3849	bleedin’ life.  I’ve ’ad the fever in Aspinwall, in ’Avana, in New
  3850	Orleans.  I near died of the scurvy and was rotten with it six months in
  3851	Barbadoes.  Smallpox in ’Onolulu, two broken legs in Shanghai, pnuemonia
  3852	in Unalaska, three busted ribs an’ my insides all twisted in ’Frisco.
  3853	An’ ’ere I am now.  Look at me!  Look at me!  My ribs kicked loose from
  3854	my back again.  I’ll be coughin’ blood before eyght bells.  ’Ow can it be
  3855	myde up to me, I arsk?  ’Oo’s goin’ to do it?  Gawd?  ’Ow Gawd must ’ave
  3856	’ated me w’en ’e signed me on for a voyage in this bloomin’ world of
  3857	’is!”
  3858	
  3859	This tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more, and then he
  3860	buckled to his work, limping and groaning, and in his eyes a great hatred
  3861	for all created things.  His diagnosis was correct, however, for he was
  3862	seized with occasional sicknesses, during which he vomited blood and
  3863	suffered great pain.  And as he said, it seemed God hated him too much to
  3864	let him die, for he ultimately grew better and waxed more malignant than
  3865	ever.
  3866	
  3867	Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about
  3868	his work in a half-hearted way.  He was still a sick man, and I more than
  3869	once observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail, or drooping
  3870	wearily as he stood at the wheel.  But, still worse, it seemed that his
  3871	spirit was broken.  He was abject before Wolf Larsen and almost grovelled
  3872	to Johansen.  Not so was the conduct of Leach.  He went about the deck
  3873	like a tiger cub, glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen.
  3874	
  3875	“I’ll do for you yet, you slab-footed Swede,” I heard him say to Johansen
  3876	one night on deck.
  3877	
  3878	The mate cursed him in the darkness, and the next moment some missile
  3879	struck the galley a sharp rap.  There was more cursing, and a mocking
  3880	laugh, and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife
  3881	imbedded over an inch in the solid wood.  A few minutes later the mate
  3882	came fumbling about in search of it, but I returned it privily to Leach
  3883	next day.  He grinned when I handed it over, yet it was a grin that
  3884	contained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of
  3885	speech common to the members of my own class.
  3886	
  3887	Unlike any one else in the ship’s company, I now found myself with no
  3888	quarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all.  The hunters possibly
  3889	no more than tolerated me, though none of them disliked me; while Smoke
  3890	and Henderson, convalescent under a deck awning and swinging day and
  3891	night in their hammocks, assured me that I was better than any hospital
  3892	nurse, and that they would not forget me at the end of the voyage when
  3893	they were paid off.  (As though I stood in need of their money!  I, who
  3894	could have bought them out, bag and baggage, and the schooner and its
  3895	equipment, a score of times over!)  But upon me had devolved the task of
  3896	tending their wounds, and pulling them through, and I did my best by
  3897	them.
  3898	
  3899	Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache which lasted two
  3900	days.  He must have suffered severely, for he called me in and obeyed my
  3901	commands like a sick child.  But nothing I could do seemed to relieve
  3902	him.  At my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking; though
  3903	why such a magnificent animal as he should have headaches at all puzzles
  3904	me.
  3905	
  3906	“’Tis the hand of God, I’m tellin’ you,” is the way Louis sees it.  “’Tis
  3907	a visitation for his black-hearted deeds, and there’s more behind and
  3908	comin’, or else—”
  3909	
  3910	“Or else,” I prompted.
  3911	
  3912	“God is noddin’ and not doin’ his duty, though it’s me as shouldn’t say
  3913	it.”
  3914	
  3915	I was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces of all.  Not
  3916	only does Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me, but he has discovered a
  3917	new reason for hating me.  It took me no little while to puzzle it out,
  3918	but I finally discovered that it was because I was more luckily born than
  3919	he—“gentleman born,” he put it.
  3920	
  3921	“And still no more dead men,” I twitted Louis, when Smoke and Henderson,
  3922	side by side, in friendly conversation, took their first exercise on
  3923	deck.
  3924	
  3925	Louis surveyed me with his shrewd grey eyes, and shook his head
  3926	portentously.  “She’s a-comin’, I tell you, and it’ll be sheets and
  3927	halyards, stand by all hands, when she begins to howl.  I’ve had the feel
  3928	iv it this long time, and I can feel it now as plainly as I feel the
  3929	rigging iv a dark night.  She’s close, she’s close.”
  3930	
  3931	“Who goes first?” I queried.
  3932	
  3933	“Not fat old Louis, I promise you,” he laughed.  “For ’tis in the bones
  3934	iv me I know that come this time next year I’ll be gazin’ in the old
  3935	mother’s eyes, weary with watchin’ iv the sea for the five sons she gave
  3936	to it.”
  3937	
  3938	“Wot’s ’e been s’yin’ to yer?” Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment later.
  3939	
  3940	“That he’s going home some day to see his mother,” I answered
  3941	diplomatically.
  3942	
  3943	“I never ’ad none,” was the Cockney’s comment, as he gazed with
  3944	lustreless, hopeless eyes into mine.
  3945	
  3946	
  3947	
  3948	
  3949	CHAPTER XIV
  3950	
  3951	
  3952	It has dawned upon me that I have never placed a proper valuation upon
  3953	womankind.  For that matter, though not amative to any considerable
  3954	degree so far as I have discovered, I was never outside the atmosphere of
  3955	women until now.  My mother and sisters were always about me, and I was
  3956	always trying to escape them; for they worried me to distraction with
  3957	their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den,
  3958	when my orderly confusion, upon which I prided myself, was turned into
  3959	worse confusion and less order, though it looked neat enough to the eye.
  3960	I never could find anything when they had departed.  But now, alas, how
  3961	welcome would have been the feel of their presence, the frou-frou and
  3962	swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested!  I am
  3963	sure, if I ever get home, that I shall never be irritable with them
  3964	again.  They may dose me and doctor me morning, noon, and night, and dust
  3965	and sweep and put my den to rights every minute of the day, and I shall
  3966	only lean back and survey it all and be thankful in that I am possessed
  3967	of a mother and some several sisters.
  3968	
  3969	All of which has set me wondering.  Where are the mothers of these twenty
  3970	and odd men on the _Ghost_?  It strikes me as unnatural and unhealthful
  3971	that men should be totally separated from women and herd through the
  3972	world by themselves.  Coarseness and savagery are the inevitable results.
  3973	These men about me should have wives, and sisters, and daughters; then
  3974	would they be capable of softness, and tenderness, and sympathy.  As it
  3975	is, not one of them is married.  In years and years not one of them has
  3976	been in contact with a good woman, or within the influence, or
  3977	redemption, which irresistibly radiates from such a creature.  There is
  3978	no balance in their lives.  Their masculinity, which in itself is of the
  3979	brute, has been over-developed.  The other and spiritual side of their
  3980	natures has been dwarfed—atrophied, in fact.
  3981	
  3982	They are a company of celibates, grinding harshly against one another and
  3983	growing daily more calloused from the grinding.  It seems to me
  3984	impossible sometimes that they ever had mothers.  It would appear that
  3985	they are a half-brute, half-human species, a race apart, wherein there is
  3986	no such thing as sex; that they are hatched out by the sun like turtle
  3987	eggs, or receive life in some similar and sordid fashion; and that all
  3988	their days they fester in brutality and viciousness, and in the end die
  3989	as unlovely as they have lived.
  3990	
  3991	Rendered curious by this new direction of ideas, I talked with Johansen
  3992	last night—the first superfluous words with which he has favoured me
  3993	since the voyage began.  He left Sweden when he was eighteen, is now
  3994	thirty-eight, and in all the intervening time has not been home once.  He
  3995	had met a townsman, a couple of years before, in some sailor
  3996	boarding-house in Chile, so that he knew his mother to be still alive.
  3997	
  3998	“She must be a pretty old woman now,” he said, staring meditatively into
  3999	the binnacle and then jerking a sharp glance at Harrison, who was
  4000	steering a point off the course.
  4001	
  4002	“When did you last write to her?”
  4003	
  4004	He performed his mental arithmetic aloud.  “Eighty-one; no—eighty-two,
  4005	eh? no—eighty-three?  Yes, eighty-three.  Ten years ago.  From some
  4006	little port in Madagascar.  I was trading.
  4007	
  4008	“You see,” he went on, as though addressing his neglected mother across
  4009	half the girth of the earth, “each year I was going home.  So what was
  4010	the good to write?  It was only a year.  And each year something
  4011	happened, and I did not go.  But I am mate, now, and when I pay off at
  4012	’Frisco, maybe with five hundred dollars, I will ship myself on a
  4013	windjammer round the Horn to Liverpool, which will give me more money;
  4014	and then I will pay my passage from there home.  Then she will not do any
  4015	more work.”
  4016	
  4017	“But does she work? now?  How old is she?”
  4018	
  4019	“About seventy,” he answered.  And then, boastingly, “We work from the
  4020	time we are born until we die, in my country.  That’s why we live so
  4021	long.  I will live to a hundred.”
  4022	
  4023	I shall never forget this conversation.  The words were the last I ever
  4024	heard him utter.  Perhaps they were the last he did utter, too.  For,
  4025	going down into the cabin to turn in, I decided that it was too stuffy to
  4026	sleep below.  It was a calm night.  We were out of the Trades, and the
  4027	_Ghost_ was forging ahead barely a knot an hour.  So I tucked a blanket
  4028	and pillow under my arm and went up on deck.
  4029	
  4030	As I passed between Harrison and the binnacle, which was built into the
  4031	top of the cabin, I noticed that he was this time fully three points off.
  4032	Thinking that he was asleep, and wishing him to escape reprimand or
  4033	worse, I spoke to him.  But he was not asleep.  His eyes were wide and
  4034	staring.  He seemed greatly perturbed, unable to reply to me.
  4035	
  4036	“What’s the matter?” I asked.  “Are you sick?”
  4037	
  4038	He shook his head, and with a deep sign as of awakening, caught his
  4039	breath.
  4040	
  4041	“You’d better get on your course, then,” I chided.
  4042	
  4043	He put a few spokes over, and I watched the compass-card swing slowly to
  4044	N.N.W. and steady itself with slight oscillations.
  4045	
  4046	I took a fresh hold on my bedclothes and was preparing to start on, when
  4047	some movement caught my eye and I looked astern to the rail.  A sinewy
  4048	hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.  A second hand took
  4049	form in the darkness beside it.  I watched, fascinated.  What visitant
  4050	from the gloom of the deep was I to behold?  Whatever it was, I knew that
  4051	it was climbing aboard by the log-line.  I saw a head, the hair wet and
  4052	straight, shape itself, and then the unmistakable eyes and face of Wolf
  4053	Larsen.  His right cheek was red with blood, which flowed from some wound
  4054	in the head.
  4055	
  4056	He drew himself inboard with a quick effort, and arose to his feet,
  4057	glancing swiftly, as he did so, at the man at the wheel, as though to
  4058	assure himself of his identity and that there was nothing to fear from
  4059	him.  The sea-water was streaming from him.  It made little audible
  4060	gurgles which distracted me.  As he stepped toward me I shrank back
  4061	instinctively, for I saw that in his eyes which spelled death.
  4062	
  4063	“All right, Hump,” he said in a low voice.  “Where’s the mate?”
  4064	
  4065	I shook my head.
  4066	
  4067	“Johansen!” he called softly.  “Johansen!”
  4068	
  4069	“Where is he?” he demanded of Harrison.
  4070	
  4071	The young fellow seemed to have recovered his composure, for he answered
  4072	steadily enough, “I don’t know, sir.  I saw him go for’ard a little while
  4073	ago.”
  4074	
  4075	“So did I go for’ard.  But you will observe that I didn’t come back the
  4076	way I went.  Can you explain it?”
  4077	
  4078	“You must have been overboard, sir.”
  4079	
  4080	“Shall I look for him in the steerage, sir?” I asked.
  4081	
  4082	Wolf Larsen shook his head.  “You wouldn’t find him, Hump.  But you’ll
  4083	do.  Come on.  Never mind your bedding.  Leave it where it is.”
  4084	
  4085	I followed at his heels.  There was nothing stirring amidships.
  4086	
  4087	“Those cursed hunters,” was his comment.  “Too damned fat and lazy to
  4088	stand a four-hour watch.”
  4089	
  4090	But on the forecastle-head we found three sailors asleep.  He turned them
  4091	over and looked at their faces.  They composed the watch on deck, and it
  4092	was the ship’s custom, in good weather, to let the watch sleep with the
  4093	exception of the officer, the helmsman, and the look-out.
  4094	
  4095	“Who’s look-out?” he demanded.
  4096	
  4097	“Me, sir,” answered Holyoak, one of the deep-water sailors, a slight
  4098	tremor in his voice.  “I winked off just this very minute, sir.  I’m
  4099	sorry, sir.  It won’t happen again.”
  4100	
  4101	“Did you hear or see anything on deck?”
  4102	
  4103	“No, sir, I—”
  4104	
  4105	But Wolf Larsen had turned away with a snort of disgust, leaving the
  4106	sailor rubbing his eyes with surprise at having been let of so easily.
  4107	
  4108	“Softly, now,” Wolf Larsen warned me in a whisper, as he doubled his body
  4109	into the forecastle scuttle and prepared to descend.
  4110	
  4111	I followed with a quaking heart.  What was to happen I knew no more than
  4112	did I know what had happened.  But blood had been shed, and it was
  4113	through no whim of Wolf Larsen that he had gone over the side with his
  4114	scalp laid open.  Besides, Johansen was missing.
  4115	
  4116	It was my first descent into the forecastle, and I shall not soon forget
  4117	my impression of it, caught as I stood on my feet at the bottom of the
  4118	ladder.  Built directly in the eyes of the schooner, it was of the shape
  4119	of a triangle, along the three sides of which stood the bunks, in
  4120	double-tier, twelve of them.  It was no larger than a hall bedroom in
  4121	Grub Street, and yet twelve men were herded into it to eat and sleep and
  4122	carry on all the functions of living.  My bedroom at home was not large,
  4123	yet it could have contained a dozen similar forecastles, and taking into
  4124	consideration the height of the ceiling, a score at least.
  4125	
  4126	It smelled sour and musty, and by the dim light of the swinging sea-lamp
  4127	I saw every bit of available wall-space hung deep with sea-boots,
  4128	oilskins, and garments, clean and dirty, of various sorts.  These swung
  4129	back and forth with every roll of the vessel, giving rise to a brushing
  4130	sound, as of trees against a roof or wall.  Somewhere a boot thumped
  4131	loudly and at irregular intervals against the wall; and, though it was a
  4132	mild night on the sea, there was a continual chorus of the creaking
  4133	timbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring.
  4134	
  4135	The sleepers did not mind.  There were eight of them,—the two watches
  4136	below,—and the air was thick with the warmth and odour of their
  4137	breathing, and the ear was filled with the noise of their snoring and of
  4138	their sighs and half-groans, tokens plain of the rest of the animal-man.
  4139	But were they sleeping? all of them?  Or had they been sleeping?  This
  4140	was evidently Wolf Larsen’s quest—to find the men who appeared to be
  4141	asleep and who were not asleep or who had not been asleep very recently.
  4142	And he went about it in a way that reminded me of a story out of
  4143	Boccaccio.
  4144	
  4145	He took the sea-lamp from its swinging frame and handed it to me.  He
  4146	began at the first bunks forward on the star-board side.  In the top one
  4147	lay Oofty-Oofty, a Kanaka and splendid seaman, so named by his mates.  He
  4148	was asleep on his back and breathing as placidly as a woman.  One arm was
  4149	under his head, the other lay on top of the blankets.  Wolf Larsen put
  4150	thumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse.  In the midst of
  4151	it the Kanaka roused.  He awoke as gently as he slept.  There was no
  4152	movement of the body whatever.  The eyes, only, moved.  They flashed wide
  4153	open, big and black, and stared, unblinking, into our faces.  Wolf Larsen
  4154	put his finger to his lips as a sign for silence, and the eyes closed
  4155	again.
  4156	
  4157	In the lower bunk lay Louis, grossly fat and warm and sweaty, asleep
  4158	unfeignedly and sleeping laboriously.  While Wolf Larsen held his wrist
  4159	he stirred uneasily, bowing his body so that for a moment it rested on
  4160	shoulders and heels.  His lips moved, and he gave voice to this enigmatic
  4161	utterance:
  4162	
  4163	“A shilling’s worth a quarter; but keep your lamps out for
  4164	thruppenny-bits, or the publicans ’ll shove ’em on you for sixpence.”
  4165	
  4166	Then he rolled over on his side with a heavy, sobbing sigh, saying:
  4167	
  4168	“A sixpence is a tanner, and a shilling a bob; but what a pony is I don’t
  4169	know.”
  4170	
  4171	Satisfied with the honesty of his and the Kanaka’s sleep, Wolf Larsen
  4172	passed on to the next two bunks on the starboard side, occupied top and
  4173	bottom, as we saw in the light of the sea-lamp, by Leach and Johnson.
  4174	
  4175	As Wolf Larsen bent down to the lower bunk to take Johnson’s pulse, I,
  4176	standing erect and holding the lamp, saw Leach’s head rise stealthily as
  4177	he peered over the side of his bunk to see what was going on.  He must
  4178	have divined Wolf Larsen’s trick and the sureness of detection, for the
  4179	light was at once dashed from my hand and the forecastle was left in
  4180	darkness.  He must have leaped, also, at the same instant, straight down
  4181	on Wolf Larsen.
  4182	
  4183	The first sounds were those of a conflict between a bull and a wolf.  I
  4184	heard a great infuriated bellow go up from Wolf Larsen, and from Leach a
  4185	snarling that was desperate and blood-curdling.  Johnson must have joined
  4186	him immediately, so that his abject and grovelling conduct on deck for
  4187	the past few days had been no more than planned deception.
  4188	
  4189	I was so terror-stricken by this fight in the dark that I leaned against
  4190	the ladder, trembling and unable to ascend.  And upon me was that old
  4191	sickness at the pit of the stomach, caused always by the spectacle of
  4192	physical violence.  In this instance I could not see, but I could hear
  4193	the impact of the blows—the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking
  4194	forcibly against flesh.  Then there was the crashing about of the
  4195	entwined bodies, the laboured breathing, the short quick gasps of sudden
  4196	pain.
  4197	
  4198	There must have been more men in the conspiracy to murder the captain and
  4199	mate, for by the sounds I knew that Leach and Johnson had been quickly
  4200	reinforced by some of their mates.
  4201	
  4202	“Get a knife somebody!” Leach was shouting.
  4203	
  4204	“Pound him on the head!  Mash his brains out!” was Johnson’s cry.
  4205	
  4206	But after his first bellow, Wolf Larsen made no noise.  He was fighting
  4207	grimly and silently for life.  He was sore beset.  Down at the very
  4208	first, he had been unable to gain his feet, and for all of his tremendous
  4209	strength I felt that there was no hope for him.
  4210	
  4211	The force with which they struggled was vividly impressed on me; for I
  4212	was knocked down by their surging bodies and badly bruised.  But in the
  4213	confusion I managed to crawl into an empty lower bunk out of the way.
  4214	
  4215	“All hands!  We’ve got him!  We’ve got him!” I could hear Leach crying.
  4216	
  4217	“Who?” demanded those who had been really asleep, and who had wakened to
  4218	they knew not what.
  4219	
  4220	“It’s the bloody mate!” was Leach’s crafty answer, strained from him in a
  4221	smothered sort of way.
  4222	
  4223	This was greeted with whoops of joy, and from then on Wolf Larsen had
  4224	seven strong men on top of him, Louis, I believe, taking no part in it.
  4225	The forecastle was like an angry hive of bees aroused by some marauder.
  4226	
  4227	“What ho! below there!” I heard Latimer shout down the scuttle, too
  4228	cautious to descend into the inferno of passion he could hear raging
  4229	beneath him in the darkness.
  4230	
  4231	“Won’t somebody get a knife?  Oh, won’t somebody get a knife?” Leach
  4232	pleaded in the first interval of comparative silence.
  4233	
  4234	The number of the assailants was a cause of confusion.  They blocked
  4235	their own efforts, while Wolf Larsen, with but a single purpose, achieved
  4236	his.  This was to fight his way across the floor to the ladder.  Though
  4237	in total darkness, I followed his progress by its sound.  No man less
  4238	than a giant could have done what he did, once he had gained the foot of
  4239	the ladder.  Step by step, by the might of his arms, the whole pack of
  4240	men striving to drag him back and down, he drew his body up from the
  4241	floor till he stood erect.  And then, step by step, hand and foot, he
  4242	slowly struggled up the ladder.
  4243	
  4244	The very last of all, I saw.  For Latimer, having finally gone for a
  4245	lantern, held it so that its light shone down the scuttle.  Wolf Larsen
  4246	was nearly to the top, though I could not see him.  All that was visible
  4247	was the mass of men fastened upon him.  It squirmed about, like some huge
  4248	many-legged spider, and swayed back and forth to the regular roll of the
  4249	vessel.  And still, step by step with long intervals between, the mass
  4250	ascended.  Once it tottered, about to fall back, but the broken hold was
  4251	regained and it still went up.
  4252	
  4253	“Who is it?” Latimer cried.
  4254	
  4255	In the rays of the lantern I could see his perplexed face peering down.
  4256	
  4257	“Larsen,” I heard a muffled voice from within the mass.
  4258	
  4259	Latimer reached down with his free hand.  I saw a hand shoot up to clasp
  4260	his.  Latimer pulled, and the next couple of steps were made with a rush.
  4261	Then Wolf Larsen’s other hand reached up and clutched the edge of the
  4262	scuttle.  The mass swung clear of the ladder, the men still clinging to
  4263	their escaping foe.  They began to drop off, to be brushed off against
  4264	the sharp edge of the scuttle, to be knocked off by the legs which were
  4265	now kicking powerfully.  Leach was the last to go, falling sheer back
  4266	from the top of the scuttle and striking on head and shoulders upon his
  4267	sprawling mates beneath.  Wolf Larsen and the lantern disappeared, and we
  4268	were left in darkness.
  4269	
  4270	
  4271	
  4272	
  4273	CHAPTER XV
  4274	
  4275	
  4276	There was a deal of cursing and groaning as the men at the bottom of the
  4277	ladder crawled to their feet.
  4278	
  4279	“Somebody strike a light, my thumb’s out of joint,” said one of the men,
  4280	Parsons, a swarthy, saturnine man, boat-steerer in Standish’s boat, in
  4281	which Harrison was puller.
  4282	
  4283	“You’ll find it knockin’ about by the bitts,” Leach said, sitting down on
  4284	the edge of the bunk in which I was concealed.
  4285	
  4286	There was a fumbling and a scratching of matches, and the sea-lamp flared
  4287	up, dim and smoky, and in its weird light bare-legged men moved about
  4288	nursing their bruises and caring for their hurts.  Oofty-Oofty laid hold
  4289	of Parsons’s thumb, pulling it out stoutly and snapping it back into
  4290	place.  I noticed at the same time that the Kanaka’s knuckles were laid
  4291	open clear across and to the bone.  He exhibited them, exposing beautiful
  4292	white teeth in a grin as he did so, and explaining that the wounds had
  4293	come from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth.
  4294	
  4295	“So it was you, was it, you black beggar?” belligerently demanded one
  4296	Kelly, an Irish-American and a longshoreman, making his first trip to
  4297	sea, and boat-puller for Kerfoot.
  4298	
  4299	As he made the demand he spat out a mouthful of blood and teeth and
  4300	shoved his pugnacious face close to Oofty-Oofty.  The Kanaka leaped
  4301	backward to his bunk, to return with a second leap, flourishing a long
  4302	knife.
  4303	
  4304	“Aw, go lay down, you make me tired,” Leach interfered.  He was
  4305	evidently, for all of his youth and inexperience, cock of the forecastle.
  4306	“G’wan, you Kelly.  You leave Oofty alone.  How in hell did he know it
  4307	was you in the dark?”
  4308	
  4309	Kelly subsided with some muttering, and the Kanaka flashed his white
  4310	teeth in a grateful smile.  He was a beautiful creature, almost feminine
  4311	in the pleasing lines of his figure, and there was a softness and
  4312	dreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to contradict his well-earned
  4313	reputation for strife and action.
  4314	
  4315	“How did he get away?” Johnson asked.
  4316	
  4317	He was sitting on the side of his bunk, the whole pose of his figure
  4318	indicating utter dejection and hopelessness.  He was still breathing
  4319	heavily from the exertion he had made.  His shirt had been ripped
  4320	entirely from him in the struggle, and blood from a gash in the cheek was
  4321	flowing down his naked chest, marking a red path across his white thigh
  4322	and dripping to the floor.
  4323	
  4324	“Because he is the devil, as I told you before,” was Leach’s answer; and
  4325	thereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment with tears in
  4326	his eyes.
  4327	
  4328	“And not one of you to get a knife!” was his unceasing lament.
  4329	
  4330	But the rest of the hands had a lively fear of consequences to come and
  4331	gave no heed to him.
  4332	
  4333	“How’ll he know which was which?” Kelly asked, and as he went on he
  4334	looked murderously about him—“unless one of us peaches.”
  4335	
  4336	“He’ll know as soon as ever he claps eyes on us,” Parsons replied.  “One
  4337	look at you’d be enough.”
  4338	
  4339	“Tell him the deck flopped up and gouged yer teeth out iv yer jaw,” Louis
  4340	grinned.  He was the only man who was not out of his bunk, and he was
  4341	jubilant in that he possessed no bruises to advertise that he had had a
  4342	hand in the night’s work.  “Just wait till he gets a glimpse iv yer mugs
  4343	to-morrow, the gang iv ye,” he chuckled.
  4344	
  4345	“We’ll say we thought it was the mate,” said one.  And another, “I know
  4346	what I’ll say—that I heered a row, jumped out of my bunk, got a jolly
  4347	good crack on the jaw for my pains, and sailed in myself.  Couldn’t tell
  4348	who or what it was in the dark and just hit out.”
  4349	
  4350	“An’ ’twas me you hit, of course,” Kelly seconded, his face brightening
  4351	for the moment.
  4352	
  4353	Leach and Johnson took no part in the discussion, and it was plain to see
  4354	that their mates looked upon them as men for whom the worst was
  4355	inevitable, who were beyond hope and already dead.  Leach stood their
  4356	fears and reproaches for some time.  Then he broke out:
  4357	
  4358	“You make me tired!  A nice lot of gazabas you are!  If you talked less
  4359	with yer mouth and did something with yer hands, he’d a-ben done with by
  4360	now.  Why couldn’t one of you, just one of you, get me a knife when I
  4361	sung out?  You make me sick!  A-beefin’ and bellerin’ ’round, as though
  4362	he’d kill you when he gets you!  You know damn well he wont.  Can’t
  4363	afford to.  No shipping masters or beach-combers over here, and he wants
  4364	yer in his business, and he wants yer bad.  Who’s to pull or steer or
  4365	sail ship if he loses yer?  It’s me and Johnson have to face the music.
  4366	Get into yer bunks, now, and shut yer faces; I want to get some sleep.”
  4367	
  4368	“That’s all right all right,” Parsons spoke up.  “Mebbe he won’t do for
  4369	us, but mark my words, hell ’ll be an ice-box to this ship from now on.”
  4370	
  4371	All the while I had been apprehensive concerning my own predicament.
  4372	What would happen to me when these men discovered my presence?  I could
  4373	never fight my way out as Wolf Larsen had done.  And at this moment
  4374	Latimer called down the scuttles:
  4375	
  4376	“Hump!  The old man wants you!”
  4377	
  4378	“He ain’t down here!” Parsons called back.
  4379	
  4380	“Yes, he is,” I said, sliding out of the bunk and striving my hardest to
  4381	keep my voice steady and bold.
  4382	
  4383	The sailors looked at me in consternation.  Fear was strong in their
  4384	faces, and the devilishness which comes of fear.
  4385	
  4386	“I’m coming!” I shouted up to Latimer.
  4387	
  4388	“No you don’t!” Kelly cried, stepping between me and the ladder, his
  4389	right hand shaped into a veritable strangler’s clutch.  “You damn little
  4390	sneak!  I’ll shut yer mouth!”
  4391	
  4392	“Let him go,” Leach commanded.
  4393	
  4394	“Not on yer life,” was the angry retort.
  4395	
  4396	Leach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk.  “Let him go, I
  4397	say,” he repeated; but this time his voice was gritty and metallic.
  4398	
  4399	The Irishman wavered.  I made to step by him, and he stood aside.  When I
  4400	had gained the ladder, I turned to the circle of brutal and malignant
  4401	faces peering at me through the semi-darkness.  A sudden and deep
  4402	sympathy welled up in me.  I remembered the Cockney’s way of putting it.
  4403	How God must have hated them that they should be tortured so!
  4404	
  4405	“I have seen and heard nothing, believe me,” I said quietly.
  4406	
  4407	“I tell yer, he’s all right,” I could hear Leach saying as I went up the
  4408	ladder.  “He don’t like the old man no more nor you or me.”
  4409	
  4410	I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin, stripped and bloody, waiting for me.
  4411	He greeted me with one of his whimsical smiles.
  4412	
  4413	“Come, get to work, Doctor.  The signs are favourable for an extensive
  4414	practice this voyage.  I don’t know what the _Ghost_ would have been
  4415	without you, and if I could only cherish such noble sentiments I would
  4416	tell you her master is deeply grateful.”
  4417	
  4418	I knew the run of the simple medicine-chest the _Ghost_ carried, and
  4419	while I was heating water on the cabin stove and getting the things ready
  4420	for dressing his wounds, he moved about, laughing and chatting, and
  4421	examining his hurts with a calculating eye.  I had never before seen him
  4422	stripped, and the sight of his body quite took my breath away.  It has
  4423	never been my weakness to exalt the flesh—far from it; but there is
  4424	enough of the artist in me to appreciate its wonder.
  4425	
  4426	I must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf Larsen’s
  4427	figure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it.  I had noted
  4428	the men in the forecastle.  Powerfully muscled though some of them were,
  4429	there had been something wrong with all of them, an insufficient
  4430	development here, an undue development there, a twist or a crook that
  4431	destroyed symmetry, legs too short or too long, or too much sinew or bone
  4432	exposed, or too little.  Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines
  4433	were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, that far had they
  4434	been what I should call feminine.
  4435	
  4436	But Wolf Larsen was the man-type, the masculine, and almost a god in his
  4437	perfectness.  As he moved about or raised his arms the great muscles
  4438	leapt and moved under the satiny skin.  I have forgotten to say that the
  4439	bronze ended with his face.  His body, thanks to his Scandinavian stock,
  4440	was fair as the fairest woman’s.  I remember his putting his hand up to
  4441	feel of the wound on his head, and my watching the biceps move like a
  4442	living thing under its white sheath.  It was the biceps that had nearly
  4443	crushed out my life once, that I had seen strike so many killing blows.
  4444	I could not take my eyes from him.  I stood motionless, a roll of
  4445	antiseptic cotton in my hand unwinding and spilling itself down to the
  4446	floor.
  4447	
  4448	He noticed me, and I became conscious that I was staring at him.
  4449	
  4450	“God made you well,” I said.
  4451	
  4452	“Did he?” he answered.  “I have often thought so myself, and wondered
  4453	why.”
  4454	
  4455	“Purpose—” I began.
  4456	
  4457	“Utility,” he interrupted.  “This body was made for use.  These muscles
  4458	were made to grip, and tear, and destroy living things that get between
  4459	me and life.  But have you thought of the other living things?  They,
  4460	too, have muscles, of one kind and another, made to grip, and tear, and
  4461	destroy; and when they come between me and life, I out-grip them,
  4462	out-tear them, out-destroy them.  Purpose does not explain that.  Utility
  4463	does.”
  4464	
  4465	“It is not beautiful,” I protested.
  4466	
  4467	“Life isn’t, you mean,” he smiled.  “Yet you say I was made well.  Do you
  4468	see this?”
  4469	
  4470	He braced his legs and feet, pressing the cabin floor with his toes in a
  4471	clutching sort of way.  Knots and ridges and mounds of muscles writhed
  4472	and bunched under the skin.
  4473	
  4474	“Feel them,” he commanded.
  4475	
  4476	They were hard as iron.  And I observed, also, that his whole body had
  4477	unconsciously drawn itself together, tense and alert; that muscles were
  4478	softly crawling and shaping about the hips, along the back, and across
  4479	the shoulders; that the arms were slightly lifted, their muscles
  4480	contracting, the fingers crooking till the hands were like talons; and
  4481	that even the eyes had changed expression and into them were coming
  4482	watchfulness and measurement and a light none other than of battle.
  4483	
  4484	“Stability, equilibrium,” he said, relaxing on the instant and sinking
  4485	his body back into repose.  “Feet with which to clutch the ground, legs
  4486	to stand on and to help withstand, while with arms and hands, teeth and
  4487	nails, I struggle to kill and to be not killed.  Purpose?  Utility is the
  4488	better word.”
  4489	
  4490	I did not argue.  I had seen the mechanism of the primitive fighting
  4491	beast, and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen the engines of a
  4492	great battleship or Atlantic liner.
  4493	
  4494	I was surprised, considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle, at
  4495	the superficiality of his hurts, and I pride myself that I dressed them
  4496	dexterously.  With the exception of several bad wounds, the rest were
  4497	merely severe bruises and lacerations.  The blow which he had received
  4498	before going overboard had laid his scalp open several inches.  This,
  4499	under his direction, I cleansed and sewed together, having first shaved
  4500	the edges of the wound.  Then the calf of his leg was badly lacerated and
  4501	looked as though it had been mangled by a bulldog.  Some sailor, he told
  4502	me, had laid hold of it by his teeth, at the beginning of the fight, and
  4503	hung on and been dragged to the top of the forecastle ladder, when he was
  4504	kicked loose.
  4505	
  4506	“By the way, Hump, as I have remarked, you are a handy man,” Wolf Larsen
  4507	began, when my work was done.  “As you know, we’re short a mate.
  4508	Hereafter you shall stand watches, receive seventy-five dollars per
  4509	month, and be addressed fore and aft as Mr. Van Weyden.”
  4510	
  4511	“I—I don’t understand navigation, you know,” I gasped.
  4512	
  4513	“Not necessary at all.”
  4514	
  4515	“I really do not care to sit in the high places,” I objected.  “I find
  4516	life precarious enough in my present humble situation.  I have no
  4517	experience.  Mediocrity, you see, has its compensations.”
  4518	
  4519	He smiled as though it were all settled.
  4520	
  4521	“I won’t be mate on this hell-ship!” I cried defiantly.
  4522	
  4523	I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes.
  4524	He walked to the door of his room, saying:
  4525	
  4526	“And now, Mr. Van Weyden, good-night.”
  4527	
  4528	“Good-night, Mr. Larsen,” I answered weakly.
  4529	
  4530	
  4531	
  4532	
  4533	CHAPTER XVI
  4534	
  4535	
  4536	I cannot say that the position of mate carried with it anything more
  4537	joyful than that there were no more dishes to wash.  I was ignorant of
  4538	the simplest duties of mate, and would have fared badly indeed, had the
  4539	sailors not sympathized with me.  I knew nothing of the minutiæ of ropes
  4540	and rigging, of the trimming and setting of sails; but the sailors took
  4541	pains to put me to rights,—Louis proving an especially good teacher,—and
  4542	I had little trouble with those under me.
  4543	
  4544	With the hunters it was otherwise.  Familiar in varying degree with the
  4545	sea, they took me as a sort of joke.  In truth, it was a joke to me, that
  4546	I, the veriest landsman, should be filling the office of mate; but to be
  4547	taken as a joke by others was a different matter.  I made no complaint,
  4548	but Wolf Larsen demanded the most punctilious sea etiquette in my
  4549	case,—far more than poor Johansen had ever received; and at the expense
  4550	of several rows, threats, and much grumbling, he brought the hunters to
  4551	time.  I was “Mr. Van Weyden” fore and aft, and it was only unofficially
  4552	that Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed me as “Hump.”
  4553	
  4554	It was amusing.  Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while we were
  4555	at dinner, and as I left the table he would say, “Mr. Van Weyden, will
  4556	you kindly put about on the port tack.”  And I would go on deck, beckon
  4557	Louis to me, and learn from him what was to be done.  Then, a few minutes
  4558	later, having digested his instructions and thoroughly mastered the
  4559	manœuvre, I would proceed to issue my orders.  I remember an early
  4560	instance of this kind, when Wolf Larsen appeared on the scene just as I
  4561	had begun to give orders.  He smoked his cigar and looked on quietly till
  4562	the thing was accomplished, and then paced aft by my side along the
  4563	weather poop.
  4564	
  4565	“Hump,” he said, “I beg pardon, Mr. Van Weyden, I congratulate you.  I
  4566	think you can now fire your father’s legs back into the grave to him.
  4567	You’ve discovered your own and learned to stand on them.  A little
  4568	rope-work, sail-making, and experience with storms and such things, and
  4569	by the end of the voyage you could ship on any coasting schooner.”
  4570	
  4571	It was during this period, between the death of Johansen and the arrival
  4572	on the sealing grounds, that I passed my pleasantest hours on the
  4573	_Ghost_.  Wolf Larsen was quite considerate, the sailors helped me, and I
  4574	was no longer in irritating contact with Thomas Mugridge.  And I make
  4575	free to say, as the days went by, that I found I was taking a certain
  4576	secret pride in myself.  Fantastic as the situation was,—a land-lubber
  4577	second in command,—I was, nevertheless, carrying it off well; and during
  4578	that brief time I was proud of myself, and I grew to love the heave and
  4579	roll of the _Ghost_ under my feet as she wallowed north and west through
  4580	the tropic sea to the islet where we filled our water-casks.
  4581	
  4582	But my happiness was not unalloyed.  It was comparative, a period of less
  4583	misery slipped in between a past of great miseries and a future of great
  4584	miseries.  For the _Ghost_, so far as the seamen were concerned, was a
  4585	hell-ship of the worst description.  They never had a moment’s rest or
  4586	peace.  Wolf Larsen treasured against them the attempt on his life and
  4587	the drubbing he had received in the forecastle; and morning, noon, and
  4588	night, and all night as well, he devoted himself to making life unlivable
  4589	for them.
  4590	
  4591	He knew well the psychology of the little thing, and it was the little
  4592	things by which he kept the crew worked up to the verge of madness.  I
  4593	have seen Harrison called from his bunk to put properly away a misplaced
  4594	paintbrush, and the two watches below haled from their tired sleep to
  4595	accompany him and see him do it.  A little thing, truly, but when
  4596	multiplied by the thousand ingenious devices of such a mind, the mental
  4597	state of the men in the forecastle may be slightly comprehended.
  4598	
  4599	Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually
  4600	occurring.  Blows were struck, and there were always two or three men
  4601	nursing injuries at the hands of the human beast who was their master.
  4602	Concerted action was impossible in face of the heavy arsenal of weapons
  4603	carried in the steerage and cabin.  Leach and Johnson were the two
  4604	particular victims of Wolf Larsen’s diabolic temper, and the look of
  4605	profound melancholy which had settled on Johnson’s face and in his eyes
  4606	made my heart bleed.
  4607	
  4608	With Leach it was different.  There was too much of the fighting beast in
  4609	him.  He seemed possessed by an insatiable fury which gave no time for
  4610	grief.  His lips had become distorted into a permanent snarl, which at
  4611	mere sight of Wolf Larsen broke out in sound, horrible and menacing and,
  4612	I do believe, unconsciously.  I have seen him follow Wolf Larsen about
  4613	with his eyes, like an animal its keeper, the while the animal-like snarl
  4614	sounded deep in his throat and vibrated forth between his teeth.
  4615	
  4616	I remember once, on deck, in bright day, touching him on the shoulder as
  4617	preliminary to giving an order.  His back was toward me, and at the first
  4618	feel of my hand he leaped upright in the air and away from me, snarling
  4619	and turning his head as he leaped.  He had for the moment mistaken me for
  4620	the man he hated.
  4621	
  4622	Both he and Johnson would have killed Wolf Larsen at the slightest
  4623	opportunity, but the opportunity never came.  Wolf Larsen was too wise
  4624	for that, and, besides, they had no adequate weapons.  With their fists
  4625	alone they had no chance whatever.  Time and again he fought it out with
  4626	Leach who fought back always, like a wildcat, tooth and nail and fist,
  4627	until stretched, exhausted or unconscious, on the deck.  And he was never
  4628	averse to another encounter.  All the devil that was in him challenged
  4629	the devil in Wolf Larsen.  They had but to appear on deck at the same
  4630	time, when they would be at it, cursing, snarling, striking; and I have
  4631	seen Leach fling himself upon Wolf Larsen without warning or provocation.
  4632	Once he threw his heavy sheath-knife, missing Wolf Larsen’s throat by an
  4633	inch.  Another time he dropped a steel marlinspike from the mizzen
  4634	crosstree.  It was a difficult cast to make on a rolling ship, but the
  4635	sharp point of the spike, whistling seventy-five feet through the air,
  4636	barely missed Wolf Larsen’s head as he emerged from the cabin
  4637	companion-way and drove its length two inches and over into the solid
  4638	deck-planking.  Still another time, he stole into the steerage, possessed
  4639	himself of a loaded shot-gun, and was making a rush for the deck with it
  4640	when caught by Kerfoot and disarmed.
  4641	
  4642	I often wondered why Wolf Larsen did not kill him and make an end of it.
  4643	But he only laughed and seemed to enjoy it.  There seemed a certain spice
  4644	about it, such as men must feel who take delight in making pets of
  4645	ferocious animals.
  4646	
  4647	“It gives a thrill to life,” he explained to me, “when life is carried in
  4648	one’s hand.  Man is a natural gambler, and life is the biggest stake he
  4649	can lay.  The greater the odds, the greater the thrill.  Why should I
  4650	deny myself the joy of exciting Leach’s soul to fever-pitch?  For that
  4651	matter, I do him a kindness.  The greatness of sensation is mutual.  He
  4652	is living more royally than any man for’ard, though he does not know it.
  4653	For he has what they have not—purpose, something to do and be done, an
  4654	all-absorbing end to strive to attain, the desire to kill me, the hope
  4655	that he may kill me.  Really, Hump, he is living deep and high.  I doubt
  4656	that he has ever lived so swiftly and keenly before, and I honestly envy
  4657	him, sometimes, when I see him raging at the summit of passion and
  4658	sensibility.”
  4659	
  4660	“Ah, but it is cowardly, cowardly!” I cried.  “You have all the
  4661	advantage.”
  4662	
  4663	“Of the two of us, you and I, who is the greater coward?” he asked
  4664	seriously.  “If the situation is unpleasing, you compromise with your
  4665	conscience when you make yourself a party to it.  If you were really
  4666	great, really true to yourself, you would join forces with Leach and
  4667	Johnson.  But you are afraid, you are afraid.  You want to live.  The
  4668	life that is in you cries out that it must live, no matter what the cost;
  4669	so you live ignominiously, untrue to the best you dream of, sinning
  4670	against your whole pitiful little code, and, if there were a hell,
  4671	heading your soul straight for it.  Bah!  I play the braver part.  I do
  4672	no sin, for I am true to the promptings of the life that is in me.  I am
  4673	sincere with my soul at least, and that is what you are not.”
  4674	
  4675	There was a sting in what he said.  Perhaps, after all, I was playing a
  4676	cowardly part.  And the more I thought about it the more it appeared that
  4677	my duty to myself lay in doing what he had advised, lay in joining forces
  4678	with Johnson and Leach and working for his death.  Right here, I think,
  4679	entered the austere conscience of my Puritan ancestry, impelling me
  4680	toward lurid deeds and sanctioning even murder as right conduct.  I dwelt
  4681	upon the idea.  It would be a most moral act to rid the world of such a
  4682	monster.  Humanity would be better and happier for it, life fairer and
  4683	sweeter.
  4684	
  4685	I pondered it long, lying sleepless in my bunk and reviewing in endless
  4686	procession the facts of the situation.  I talked with Johnson and Leach,
  4687	during the night watches when Wolf Larsen was below.  Both men had lost
  4688	hope—Johnson, because of temperamental despondency; Leach, because he had
  4689	beaten himself out in the vain struggle and was exhausted.  But he caught
  4690	my hand in a passionate grip one night, saying:
  4691	
  4692	“I think yer square, Mr. Van Weyden.  But stay where you are and keep yer
  4693	mouth shut.  Say nothin’ but saw wood.  We’re dead men, I know it; but
  4694	all the same you might be able to do us a favour some time when we need
  4695	it damn bad.”
  4696	
  4697	It was only next day, when Wainwright Island loomed to windward, close
  4698	abeam, that Wolf Larsen opened his mouth in prophecy.  He had attacked
  4699	Johnson, been attacked by Leach, and had just finished whipping the pair
  4700	of them.
  4701	
  4702	“Leach,” he said, “you know I’m going to kill you some time or other,
  4703	don’t you?”
  4704	
  4705	A snarl was the answer.
  4706	
  4707	“And as for you, Johnson, you’ll get so tired of life before I’m through
  4708	with you that you’ll fling yourself over the side.  See if you don’t.”
  4709	
  4710	“That’s a suggestion,” he added, in an aside to me.  “I’ll bet you a
  4711	month’s pay he acts upon it.”
  4712	
  4713	I had cherished a hope that his victims would find an opportunity to
  4714	escape while filling our water-barrels, but Wolf Larsen had selected his
  4715	spot well.  The _Ghost_ lay half-a-mile beyond the surf-line of a lonely
  4716	beach.  Here debauched a deep gorge, with precipitous, volcanic walls
  4717	which no man could scale.  And here, under his direct supervision—for he
  4718	went ashore himself—Leach and Johnson filled the small casks and rolled
  4719	them down to the beach.  They had no chance to make a break for liberty
  4720	in one of the boats.
  4721	
  4722	Harrison and Kelly, however, made such an attempt.  They composed one of
  4723	the boats’ crews, and their task was to ply between the schooner and the
  4724	shore, carrying a single cask each trip.  Just before dinner, starting
  4725	for the beach with an empty barrel, they altered their course and bore
  4726	away to the left to round the promontory which jutted into the sea
  4727	between them and liberty.  Beyond its foaming base lay the pretty
  4728	villages of the Japanese colonists and smiling valleys which penetrated
  4729	deep into the interior.  Once in the fastnesses they promised, and the
  4730	two men could defy Wolf Larsen.
  4731	
  4732	I had observed Henderson and Smoke loitering about the deck all morning,
  4733	and I now learned why they were there.  Procuring their rifles, they
  4734	opened fire in a leisurely manner, upon the deserters.  It was a
  4735	cold-blooded exhibition of marksmanship.  At first their bullets zipped
  4736	harmlessly along the surface of the water on either side the boat; but,
  4737	as the men continued to pull lustily, they struck closer and closer.
  4738	
  4739	“Now, watch me take Kelly’s right oar,” Smoke said, drawing a more
  4740	careful aim.
  4741	
  4742	I was looking through the glasses, and I saw the oar-blade shatter as he
  4743	shot.  Henderson duplicated it, selecting Harrison’s right oar.  The boat
  4744	slewed around.  The two remaining oars were quickly broken.  The men
  4745	tried to row with the splinters, and had them shot out of their hands.
  4746	Kelly ripped up a bottom board and began paddling, but dropped it with a
  4747	cry of pain as its splinters drove into his hands.  Then they gave up,
  4748	letting the boat drift till a second boat, sent from the shore by Wolf
  4749	Larsen, took them in tow and brought them aboard.
  4750	
  4751	Late that afternoon we hove up anchor and got away.  Nothing was before
  4752	us but the three or four months’ hunting on the sealing grounds.  The
  4753	outlook was black indeed, and I went about my work with a heavy heart.
  4754	An almost funereal gloom seemed to have descended upon the _Ghost_.  Wolf
  4755	Larsen had taken to his bunk with one of his strange, splitting
  4756	headaches.  Harrison stood listlessly at the wheel, half supporting
  4757	himself by it, as though wearied by the weight of his flesh.  The rest of
  4758	the men were morose and silent.  I came upon Kelly crouching to the lee
  4759	of the forecastle scuttle, his head on his knees, his arms about his
  4760	head, in an attitude of unutterable despondency.
  4761	
  4762	Johnson I found lying full length on the forecastle head, staring at the
  4763	troubled churn of the forefoot, and I remembered with horror the
  4764	suggestion Wolf Larsen had made.  It seemed likely to bear fruit.  I
  4765	tried to break in on the man’s morbid thoughts by calling him away, but
  4766	he smiled sadly at me and refused to obey.
  4767	
  4768	Leach approached me as I returned aft.
  4769	
  4770	“I want to ask a favour, Mr. Van Weyden,” he said.  “If it’s yer luck to
  4771	ever make ’Frisco once more, will you hunt up Matt McCarthy?  He’s my old
  4772	man.  He lives on the Hill, back of the Mayfair bakery, runnin’ a
  4773	cobbler’s shop that everybody knows, and you’ll have no trouble.  Tell
  4774	him I lived to be sorry for the trouble I brought him and the things I
  4775	done, and—and just tell him ‘God bless him,’ for me.”
  4776	
  4777	I nodded my head, but said, “We’ll all win back to San Francisco, Leach,
  4778	and you’ll be with me when I go to see Matt McCarthy.”
  4779	
  4780	“I’d like to believe you,” he answered, shaking my hand, “but I can’t.
  4781	Wolf Larsen ’ll do for me, I know it; and all I can hope is, he’ll do it
  4782	quick.”
  4783	
  4784	And as he left me I was aware of the same desire at my heart.  Since it
  4785	was to be done, let it be done with despatch.  The general gloom had
  4786	gathered me into its folds.  The worst appeared inevitable; and as I
  4787	paced the deck, hour after hour, I found myself afflicted with Wolf
  4788	Larsen’s repulsive ideas.  What was it all about?  Where was the grandeur
  4789	of life that it should permit such wanton destruction of human souls?  It
  4790	was a cheap and sordid thing after all, this life, and the sooner over
  4791	the better.  Over and done with!  I, too, leaned upon the rail and gazed
  4792	longingly into the sea, with the certainty that sooner or later I should
  4793	be sinking down, down, through the cool green depths of its oblivion.
  4794	
  4795	
  4796	
  4797	
  4798	CHAPTER XVII
  4799	
  4800	
  4801	Strange to say, in spite of the general foreboding, nothing of especial
  4802	moment happened on the _Ghost_.  We ran on to the north and west till we
  4803	raised the coast of Japan and picked up with the great seal herd.  Coming
  4804	from no man knew where in the illimitable Pacific, it was travelling
  4805	north on its annual migration to the rookeries of Bering Sea.  And north
  4806	we travelled with it, ravaging and destroying, flinging the naked
  4807	carcasses to the shark and salting down the skins so that they might
  4808	later adorn the fair shoulders of the women of the cities.
  4809	
  4810	It was wanton slaughter, and all for woman’s sake.  No man ate of the
  4811	seal meat or the oil.  After a good day’s killing I have seen our decks
  4812	covered with hides and bodies, slippery with fat and blood, the scuppers
  4813	running red; masts, ropes, and rails spattered with the sanguinary
  4814	colour; and the men, like butchers plying their trade, naked and red of
  4815	arm and hand, hard at work with ripping and flensing-knives, removing the
  4816	skins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed.
  4817	
  4818	It was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from the boats, to
  4819	oversee the skinning and afterward the cleansing of the decks and
  4820	bringing things ship-shape again.  It was not pleasant work.  My soul and
  4821	my stomach revolted at it; and yet, in a way, this handling and directing
  4822	of many men was good for me.  It developed what little executive ability
  4823	I possessed, and I was aware of a toughening or hardening which I was
  4824	undergoing and which could not be anything but wholesome for “Sissy” Van
  4825	Weyden.
  4826	
  4827	One thing I was beginning to feel, and that was that I could never again
  4828	be quite the same man I had been.  While my hope and faith in human life
  4829	still survived Wolf Larsen’s destructive criticism, he had nevertheless
  4830	been a cause of change in minor matters.  He had opened up for me the
  4831	world of the real, of which I had known practically nothing and from
  4832	which I had always shrunk.  I had learned to look more closely at life as
  4833	it was lived, to recognize that there were such things as facts in the
  4834	world, to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain
  4835	values on the concrete and objective phases of existence.
  4836	
  4837	I saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the grounds.  For
  4838	when the weather was fair and we were in the midst of the herd, all hands
  4839	were away in the boats, and left on board were only he and I, and Thomas
  4840	Mugridge, who did not count.  But there was no play about it.  The six
  4841	boats, spreading out fan-wise from the schooner until the first weather
  4842	boat and the last lee boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart,
  4843	cruised along a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad
  4844	weather drove them in.  It was our duty to sail the _Ghost_ well to
  4845	leeward of the last lee boat, so that all the boats should have fair wind
  4846	to run for us in case of squalls or threatening weather.
  4847	
  4848	It is no slight matter for two men, particularly when a stiff wind has
  4849	sprung up, to handle a vessel like the _Ghost_, steering, keeping
  4850	look-out for the boats, and setting or taking in sail; so it devolved
  4851	upon me to learn, and learn quickly.  Steering I picked up easily, but
  4852	running aloft to the crosstrees and swinging my whole weight by my arms
  4853	when I left the ratlines and climbed still higher, was more difficult.
  4854	This, too, I learned, and quickly, for I felt somehow a wild desire to
  4855	vindicate myself in Wolf Larsen’s eyes, to prove my right to live in ways
  4856	other than of the mind.  Nay, the time came when I took joy in the run of
  4857	the masthead and in the clinging on by my legs at that precarious height
  4858	while I swept the sea with glasses in search of the boats.
  4859	
  4860	I remember one beautiful day, when the boats left early and the reports
  4861	of the hunters’ guns grew dim and distant and died away as they scattered
  4862	far and wide over the sea.  There was just the faintest wind from the
  4863	westward; but it breathed its last by the time we managed to get to
  4864	leeward of the last lee boat.  One by one—I was at the masthead and
  4865	saw—the six boats disappeared over the bulge of the earth as they
  4866	followed the seal into the west.  We lay, scarcely rolling on the placid
  4867	sea, unable to follow.  Wolf Larsen was apprehensive.  The barometer was
  4868	down, and the sky to the east did not please him.  He studied it with
  4869	unceasing vigilance.
  4870	
  4871	“If she comes out of there,” he said, “hard and snappy, putting us to
  4872	windward of the boats, it’s likely there’ll be empty bunks in steerage
  4873	and fo’c’sle.”
  4874	
  4875	By eleven o’clock the sea had become glass.  By midday, though we were
  4876	well up in the northerly latitudes, the heat was sickening.  There was no
  4877	freshness in the air.  It was sultry and oppressive, reminding me of what
  4878	the old Californians term “earthquake weather.”  There was something
  4879	ominous about it, and in intangible ways one was made to feel that the
  4880	worst was about to come.  Slowly the whole eastern sky filled with clouds
  4881	that over-towered us like some black sierra of the infernal regions.  So
  4882	clearly could one see cañon, gorge, and precipice, and the shadows that
  4883	lie therein, that one looked unconsciously for the white surf-line and
  4884	bellowing caverns where the sea charges on the land.  And still we rocked
  4885	gently, and there was no wind.
  4886	
  4887	“It’s no square” Wolf Larsen said.  “Old Mother Nature’s going to get up
  4888	on her hind legs and howl for all that’s in her, and it’ll keep us
  4889	jumping, Hump, to pull through with half our boats.  You’d better run up
  4890	and loosen the topsails.”
  4891	
  4892	“But if it is going to howl, and there are only two of us?” I asked, a
  4893	note of protest in my voice.
  4894	
  4895	“Why we’ve got to make the best of the first of it and run down to our
  4896	boats before our canvas is ripped out of us.  After that I don’t give a
  4897	rap what happens.  The sticks ’ll stand it, and you and I will have to,
  4898	though we’ve plenty cut out for us.”
  4899	
  4900	Still the calm continued.  We ate dinner, a hurried and anxious meal for
  4901	me with eighteen men abroad on the sea and beyond the bulge of the earth,
  4902	and with that heaven-rolling mountain range of clouds moving slowly down
  4903	upon us.  Wolf Larsen did not seem affected, however; though I noticed,
  4904	when we returned to the deck, a slight twitching of the nostrils, a
  4905	perceptible quickness of movement.  His face was stern, the lines of it
  4906	had grown hard, and yet in his eyes—blue, clear blue this day—there was a
  4907	strange brilliancy, a bright scintillating light.  It struck me that he
  4908	was joyous, in a ferocious sort of way; that he was glad there was an
  4909	impending struggle; that he was thrilled and upborne with knowledge that
  4910	one of the great moments of living, when the tide of life surges up in
  4911	flood, was upon him.
  4912	
  4913	Once, and unwitting that he did so or that I saw, he laughed aloud,
  4914	mockingly and defiantly, at the advancing storm.  I see him yet standing
  4915	there like a pigmy out of the _Arabian Nights_ before the huge front of
  4916	some malignant genie.  He was daring destiny, and he was unafraid.
  4917	
  4918	He walked to the galley.  “Cooky, by the time you’ve finished pots and
  4919	pans you’ll be wanted on deck.  Stand ready for a call.”
  4920	
  4921	“Hump,” he said, becoming cognizant of the fascinated gaze I bent upon
  4922	him, “this beats whisky and is where your Omar misses.  I think he only
  4923	half lived after all.”
  4924	
  4925	The western half of the sky had by now grown murky.  The sun had dimmed
  4926	and faded out of sight.  It was two in the afternoon, and a ghostly
  4927	twilight, shot through by wandering purplish lights, had descended upon
  4928	us.  In this purplish light Wolf Larsen’s face glowed and glowed, and to
  4929	my excited fancy he appeared encircled by a halo.  We lay in the midst of
  4930	an unearthly quiet, while all about us were signs and omens of oncoming
  4931	sound and movement.  The sultry heat had become unendurable.  The sweat
  4932	was standing on my forehead, and I could feel it trickling down my nose.
  4933	I felt as though I should faint, and reached out to the rail for support.
  4934	
  4935	And then, just then, the faintest possible whisper of air passed by.  It
  4936	was from the east, and like a whisper it came and went.  The drooping
  4937	canvas was not stirred, and yet my face had felt the air and been cooled.
  4938	
  4939	“Cooky,” Wolf Larsen called in a low voice.  Thomas Mugridge turned a
  4940	pitiable scared face.  “Let go that foreboom tackle and pass it across,
  4941	and when she’s willing let go the sheet and come in snug with the tackle.
  4942	And if you make a mess of it, it will be the last you ever make.
  4943	Understand?”
  4944	
  4945	“Mr. Van Weyden, stand by to pass the head-sails over.  Then jump for the
  4946	topsails and spread them quick as God’ll let you—the quicker you do it
  4947	the easier you’ll find it.  As for Cooky, if he isn’t lively bat him
  4948	between the eyes.”
  4949	
  4950	I was aware of the compliment and pleased, in that no threat had
  4951	accompanied my instructions.  We were lying head to north-west, and it
  4952	was his intention to jibe over all with the first puff.
  4953	
  4954	“We’ll have the breeze on our quarter,” he explained to me.  “By the last
  4955	guns the boats were bearing away slightly to the south’ard.”
  4956	
  4957	He turned and walked aft to the wheel.  I went forward and took my
  4958	station at the jibs.  Another whisper of wind, and another, passed by.
  4959	The canvas flapped lazily.
  4960	
  4961	“Thank Gawd she’s not comin’ all of a bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,” was the
  4962	Cockney’s fervent ejaculation.
  4963	
  4964	And I was indeed thankful, for I had by this time learned enough to know,
  4965	with all our canvas spread, what disaster in such event awaited us.  The
  4966	whispers of wind became puffs, the sails filled, the _Ghost_ moved.  Wolf
  4967	Larsen put the wheel hard up, to port, and we began to pay off.  The wind
  4968	was now dead astern, muttering and puffing stronger and stronger, and my
  4969	head-sails were pounding lustily.  I did not see what went on elsewhere,
  4970	though I felt the sudden surge and heel of the schooner as the
  4971	wind-pressures changed to the jibing of the fore- and main-sails.  My
  4972	hands were full with the flying-jib, jib, and staysail; and by the time
  4973	this part of my task was accomplished the _Ghost_ was leaping into the
  4974	south-west, the wind on her quarter and all her sheets to starboard.
  4975	Without pausing for breath, though my heart was beating like a
  4976	trip-hammer from my exertions, I sprang to the topsails, and before the
  4977	wind had become too strong we had them fairly set and were coiling down.
  4978	Then I went aft for orders.
  4979	
  4980	Wolf Larsen nodded approval and relinquished the wheel to me.  The wind
  4981	was strengthening steadily and the sea rising.  For an hour I steered,
  4982	each moment becoming more difficult.  I had not the experience to steer
  4983	at the gait we were going on a quartering course.
  4984	
  4985	“Now take a run up with the glasses and raise some of the boats.  We’ve
  4986	made at least ten knots, and we’re going twelve or thirteen now.  The old
  4987	girl knows how to walk.”
  4988	
  4989	I contested myself with the fore crosstrees, some seventy feet above the
  4990	deck.  As I searched the vacant stretch of water before me, I
  4991	comprehended thoroughly the need for haste if we were to recover any of
  4992	our men.  Indeed, as I gazed at the heavy sea through which we were
  4993	running, I doubted that there was a boat afloat.  It did not seem
  4994	possible that such frail craft could survive such stress of wind and
  4995	water.
  4996	
  4997	I could not feel the full force of the wind, for we were running with it;
  4998	but from my lofty perch I looked down as though outside the _Ghost_ and
  4999	apart from her, and saw the shape of her outlined sharply against the
  5000	foaming sea as she tore along instinct with life.  Sometimes she would
  5001	lift and send across some great wave, burying her starboard-rail from
  5002	view, and covering her deck to the hatches with the boiling ocean.  At
  5003	such moments, starting from a windward roll, I would go flying through
  5004	the air with dizzying swiftness, as though I clung to the end of a huge,
  5005	inverted pendulum, the arc of which, between the greater rolls, must have
  5006	been seventy feet or more.  Once, the terror of this giddy sweep
  5007	overpowered me, and for a while I clung on, hand and foot, weak and
  5008	trembling, unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold
  5009	aught of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm
  5010	the _Ghost_.
  5011	
  5012	But the thought of the men in the midst of it steadied me, and in my
  5013	quest for them I forgot myself.  For an hour I saw nothing but the naked,
  5014	desolate sea.  And then, where a vagrant shaft of sunlight struck the
  5015	ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver, I caught a small black
  5016	speck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up.  I waited
  5017	patiently.  Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the
  5018	wrathful blaze a couple of points off our port-bow.  I did not attempt to
  5019	shout, but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm.  He
  5020	changed the course, and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed
  5021	dead ahead.
  5022	
  5023	It grew larger, and so swiftly that for the first time I fully
  5024	appreciated the speed of our flight.  Wolf Larsen motioned for me to come
  5025	down, and when I stood beside him at the wheel gave me instructions for
  5026	heaving to.
  5027	
  5028	“Expect all hell to break loose,” he cautioned me, “but don’t mind it.
  5029	Yours is to do your own work and to have Cooky stand by the fore-sheet.”
  5030	
  5031	I managed to make my way forward, but there was little choice of sides,
  5032	for the weather-rail seemed buried as often as the lee.  Having
  5033	instructed Thomas Mugridge as to what he was to do, I clambered into the
  5034	fore-rigging a few feet.  The boat was now very close, and I could make
  5035	out plainly that it was lying head to wind and sea and dragging on its
  5036	mast and sail, which had been thrown overboard and made to serve as a
  5037	sea-anchor.  The three men were bailing.  Each rolling mountain whelmed
  5038	them from view, and I would wait with sickening anxiety, fearing that
  5039	they would never appear again.  Then, and with black suddenness, the boat
  5040	would shoot clear through the foaming crest, bow pointed to the sky, and
  5041	the whole length of her bottom showing, wet and dark, till she seemed on
  5042	end.  There would be a fleeting glimpse of the three men flinging water
  5043	in frantic haste, when she would topple over and fall into the yawning
  5044	valley, bow down and showing her full inside length to the stern upreared
  5045	almost directly above the bow.  Each time that she reappeared was a
  5046	miracle.
  5047	
  5048	The _Ghost_ suddenly changed her course, keeping away, and it came to me
  5049	with a shock that Wolf Larsen was giving up the rescue as impossible.
  5050	Then I realized that he was preparing to heave to, and dropped to the
  5051	deck to be in readiness.  We were now dead before the wind, the boat far
  5052	away and abreast of us.  I felt an abrupt easing of the schooner, a loss
  5053	for the moment of all strain and pressure, coupled with a swift
  5054	acceleration of speed.  She was rushing around on her heel into the wind.
  5055	
  5056	As she arrived at right angles to the sea, the full force of the wind
  5057	(from which we had hitherto run away) caught us.  I was unfortunately and
  5058	ignorantly facing it.  It stood up against me like a wall, filling my
  5059	lungs with air which I could not expel.  And as I choked and strangled,
  5060	and as the _Ghost_ wallowed for an instant, broadside on and rolling
  5061	straight over and far into the wind, I beheld a huge sea rise far above
  5062	my head.  I turned aside, caught my breath, and looked again.  The wave
  5063	over-topped the _Ghost_, and I gazed sheer up and into it.  A shaft of
  5064	sunlight smote the over-curl, and I caught a glimpse of translucent,
  5065	rushing green, backed by a milky smother of foam.
  5066	
  5067	Then it descended, pandemonium broke loose, everything happened at once.
  5068	I was struck a crushing, stunning blow, nowhere in particular and yet
  5069	everywhere.  My hold had been broken loose, I was under water, and the
  5070	thought passed through my mind that this was the terrible thing of which
  5071	I had heard, the being swept in the trough of the sea.  My body struck
  5072	and pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over,
  5073	and when I could hold my breath no longer, I breathed the stinging salt
  5074	water into my lungs.  But through it all I clung to the one idea—_I must
  5075	get the jib backed over to windward_.  I had no fear of death.  I had no
  5076	doubt but that I should come through somehow.  And as this idea of
  5077	fulfilling Wolf Larsen’s order persisted in my dazed consciousness, I
  5078	seemed to see him standing at the wheel in the midst of the wild welter,
  5079	pitting his will against the will of the storm and defying it.
  5080	
  5081	I brought up violently against what I took to be the rail, breathed, and
  5082	breathed the sweet air again.  I tried to rise, but struck my head and
  5083	was knocked back on hands and knees.  By some freak of the waters I had
  5084	been swept clear under the forecastle-head and into the eyes.  As I
  5085	scrambled out on all fours, I passed over the body of Thomas Mugridge,
  5086	who lay in a groaning heap.  There was no time to investigate.  I must
  5087	get the jib backed over.
  5088	
  5089	When I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything had come.  On
  5090	all sides there was a rending and crashing of wood and steel and canvas.
  5091	The _Ghost_ was being wrenched and torn to fragments.  The foresail and
  5092	fore-topsail, emptied of the wind by the manœuvre, and with no one to
  5093	bring in the sheet in time, were thundering into ribbons, the heavy boom
  5094	threshing and splintering from rail to rail.  The air was thick with
  5095	flying wreckage, detached ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like
  5096	snakes, and down through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail.
  5097	
  5098	The spar could not have missed me by many inches, while it spurred me to
  5099	action.  Perhaps the situation was not hopeless.  I remembered Wolf
  5100	Larsen’s caution.  He had expected all hell to break loose, and here it
  5101	was.  And where was he?  I caught sight of him toiling at the main-sheet,
  5102	heaving it in and flat with his tremendous muscles, the stern of the
  5103	schooner lifted high in the air and his body outlined against a white
  5104	surge of sea sweeping past.  All this, and more,—a whole world of chaos
  5105	and wreck,—in possibly fifteen seconds I had seen and heard and grasped.
  5106	
  5107	I did not stop to see what had become of the small boat, but sprang to
  5108	the jib-sheet.  The jib itself was beginning to slap, partially filling
  5109	and emptying with sharp reports; but with a turn of the sheet and the
  5110	application of my whole strength each time it slapped, I slowly backed
  5111	it.  This I know: I did my best.  I pulled till I burst open the ends of
  5112	all my fingers; and while I pulled, the flying-jib and staysail split
  5113	their cloths apart and thundered into nothingness.
  5114	
  5115	Still I pulled, holding what I gained each time with a double turn until
  5116	the next slap gave me more.  Then the sheet gave with greater ease, and
  5117	Wolf Larsen was beside me, heaving in alone while I was busied taking up
  5118	the slack.
  5119	
  5120	“Make fast!” he shouted.  “And come on!”
  5121	
  5122	As I followed him, I noted that in spite of rack and ruin a rough order
  5123	obtained.  The _Ghost_ was hove to.  She was still in working order, and
  5124	she was still working.  Though the rest of her sails were gone, the jib,
  5125	backed to windward, and the mainsail hauled down flat, were themselves
  5126	holding, and holding her bow to the furious sea as well.
  5127	
  5128	I looked for the boat, and, while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles,
  5129	saw it lift to leeward on a big sea an not a score of feet away.  And, so
  5130	nicely had he made his calculation, we drifted fairly down upon it, so
  5131	that nothing remained to do but hook the tackles to either end and hoist
  5132	it aboard.  But this was not done so easily as it is written.
  5133	
  5134	In the bow was Kerfoot, Oofty-Oofty in the stern, and Kelly amidships.
  5135	As we drifted closer the boat would rise on a wave while we sank in the
  5136	trough, till almost straight above me I could see the heads of the three
  5137	men craned overside and looking down.  Then, the next moment, we would
  5138	lift and soar upward while they sank far down beneath us.  It seemed
  5139	incredible that the next surge should not crush the _Ghost_ down upon the
  5140	tiny eggshell.
  5141	
  5142	But, at the right moment, I passed the tackle to the Kanaka, while Wolf
  5143	Larsen did the same thing forward to Kerfoot.  Both tackles were hooked
  5144	in a trice, and the three men, deftly timing the roll, made a
  5145	simultaneous leap aboard the schooner.  As the _Ghost_ rolled her side
  5146	out of water, the boat was lifted snugly against her, and before the
  5147	return roll came, we had heaved it in over the side and turned it bottom
  5148	up on the deck.  I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot’s left hand.  In
  5149	some way the third finger had been crushed to a pulp.  But he gave no
  5150	sign of pain, and with his single right hand helped us lash the boat in
  5151	its place.
  5152	
  5153	“Stand by to let that jib over, you Oofty!” Wolf Larsen commanded, the
  5154	very second we had finished with the boat.  “Kelly, come aft and slack
  5155	off the main-sheet!  You, Kerfoot, go for’ard and see what’s become of
  5156	Cooky!  Mr. Van Weyden, run aloft again, and cut away any stray stuff on
  5157	your way!”
  5158	
  5159	And having commanded, he went aft with his peculiar tigerish leaps to the
  5160	wheel.  While I toiled up the fore-shrouds the _Ghost_ slowly paid off.
  5161	This time, as we went into the trough of the sea and were swept, there
  5162	were no sails to carry away.  And, halfway to the crosstrees and
  5163	flattened against the rigging by the full force of the wind so that it
  5164	would have been impossible for me to have fallen, the _Ghost_ almost on
  5165	her beam-ends and the masts parallel with the water, I looked, not down,
  5166	but at almost right angles from the perpendicular, to the deck of the
  5167	_Ghost_.  But I saw, not the deck, but where the deck should have been,
  5168	for it was buried beneath a wild tumbling of water.  Out of this water I
  5169	could see the two masts rising, and that was all.  The _Ghost_, for the
  5170	moment, was buried beneath the sea.  As she squared off more and more,
  5171	escaping from the side pressure, she righted herself and broke her deck,
  5172	like a whale’s back, through the ocean surface.
  5173	
  5174	Then we raced, and wildly, across the wild sea, the while I hung like a
  5175	fly in the crosstrees and searched for the other boats.  In half-an-hour
  5176	I sighted the second one, swamped and bottom up, to which were
  5177	desperately clinging Jock Horner, fat Louis, and Johnson.  This time I
  5178	remained aloft, and Wolf Larsen succeeded in heaving to without being
  5179	swept.  As before, we drifted down upon it.  Tackles were made fast and
  5180	lines flung to the men, who scrambled aboard like monkeys.  The boat
  5181	itself was crushed and splintered against the schooner’s side as it came
  5182	inboard; but the wreck was securely lashed, for it could be patched and
  5183	made whole again.
  5184	
  5185	Once more the _Ghost_ bore away before the storm, this time so submerging
  5186	herself that for some seconds I thought she would never reappear.  Even
  5187	the wheel, quite a deal higher than the waist, was covered and swept
  5188	again and again.  At such moments I felt strangely alone with God, alone
  5189	with him and watching the chaos of his wrath.  And then the wheel would
  5190	reappear, and Wolf Larsen’s broad shoulders, his hands gripping the
  5191	spokes and holding the schooner to the course of his will, himself an
  5192	earth-god, dominating the storm, flinging its descending waters from him
  5193	and riding it to his own ends.  And oh, the marvel of it! the marvel of
  5194	it!  That tiny men should live and breathe and work, and drive so frail a
  5195	contrivance of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife.
  5196	
  5197	As before, the _Ghost_ swung out of the trough, lifting her deck again
  5198	out of the sea, and dashed before the howling blast.  It was now
  5199	half-past five, and half-an-hour later, when the last of the day lost
  5200	itself in a dim and furious twilight, I sighted a third boat.  It was
  5201	bottom up, and there was no sign of its crew.  Wolf Larsen repeated his
  5202	manœuvre, holding off and then rounding up to windward and drifting down
  5203	upon it.  But this time he missed by forty feet, the boat passing astern.
  5204	
  5205	“Number four boat!” Oofty-Oofty cried, his keen eyes reading its number
  5206	in the one second when it lifted clear of the foam, and upside down.
  5207	
  5208	It was Henderson’s boat and with him had been lost Holyoak and Williams,
  5209	another of the deep-water crowd.  Lost they indubitably were; but the
  5210	boat remained, and Wolf Larsen made one more reckless effort to recover
  5211	it.  I had come down to the deck, and I saw Horner and Kerfoot vainly
  5212	protest against the attempt.
  5213	
  5214	“By God, I’ll not be robbed of my boat by any storm that ever blew out of
  5215	hell!” he shouted, and though we four stood with our heads together that
  5216	we might hear, his voice seemed faint and far, as though removed from us
  5217	an immense distance.
  5218	
  5219	“Mr. Van Weyden!” he cried, and I heard through the tumult as one might
  5220	hear a whisper.  “Stand by that jib with Johnson and Oofty!  The rest of
  5221	you tail aft to the mainsheet!  Lively now! or I’ll sail you all into
  5222	Kingdom Come!  Understand?”
  5223	
  5224	And when he put the wheel hard over and the _Ghost’s_ bow swung off,
  5225	there was nothing for the hunters to do but obey and make the best of a
  5226	risky chance.  How great the risk I realized when I was once more buried
  5227	beneath the pounding seas and clinging for life to the pinrail at the
  5228	foot of the foremast.  My fingers were torn loose, and I swept across to
  5229	the side and over the side into the sea.  I could not swim, but before I
  5230	could sink I was swept back again.  A strong hand gripped me, and when
  5231	the _Ghost_ finally emerged, I found that I owed my life to Johnson.  I
  5232	saw him looking anxiously about him, and noted that Kelly, who had come
  5233	forward at the last moment, was missing.
  5234	
  5235	This time, having missed the boat, and not being in the same position as
  5236	in the previous instances, Wolf Larsen was compelled to resort to a
  5237	different manœuvre.  Running off before the wind with everything to
  5238	starboard, he came about, and returned close-hauled on the port tack.
  5239	
  5240	“Grand!” Johnson shouted in my ear, as we successfully came through the
  5241	attendant deluge, and I knew he referred, not to Wolf Larsen’s
  5242	seamanship, but to the performance of the _Ghost_ herself.
  5243	
  5244	It was now so dark that there was no sign of the boat; but Wolf Larsen
  5245	held back through the frightful turmoil as if guided by unerring
  5246	instinct.  This time, though we were continually half-buried, there was
  5247	no trough in which to be swept, and we drifted squarely down upon the
  5248	upturned boat, badly smashing it as it was heaved inboard.
  5249	
  5250	Two hours of terrible work followed, in which all hands of us—two
  5251	hunters, three sailors, Wolf Larsen and I—reefed, first one and then the
  5252	other, the jib and mainsail.  Hove to under this short canvas, our decks
  5253	were comparatively free of water, while the _Ghost_ bobbed and ducked
  5254	amongst the combers like a cork.
  5255	
  5256	I had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first, and during the
  5257	reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks.  And when
  5258	all was done, I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the
  5259	agony of exhaustion.
  5260	
  5261	In the meantime Thomas Mugridge, like a drowned rat, was being dragged
  5262	out from under the forecastle head where he had cravenly ensconced
  5263	himself.  I saw him pulled aft to the cabin, and noted with a shock of
  5264	surprise that the galley had disappeared.  A clean space of deck showed
  5265	where it had stood.
  5266	
  5267	In the cabin I found all hands assembled, sailors as well, and while
  5268	coffee was being cooked over the small stove we drank whisky and crunched
  5269	hard-tack.  Never in my life had food been so welcome.  And never had hot
  5270	coffee tasted so good.  So violently did the _Ghost_, pitch and toss and
  5271	tumble that it was impossible for even the sailors to move about without
  5272	holding on, and several times, after a cry of “Now she takes it!” we were
  5273	heaped upon the wall of the port cabins as though it had been the deck.
  5274	
  5275	“To hell with a look-out,” I heard Wolf Larsen say when we had eaten and
  5276	drunk our fill.  “There’s nothing can be done on deck.  If anything’s
  5277	going to run us down we couldn’t get out of its way.  Turn in, all hands,
  5278	and get some sleep.”
  5279	
  5280	The sailors slipped forward, setting the side-lights as they went, while
  5281	the two hunters remained to sleep in the cabin, it not being deemed
  5282	advisable to open the slide to the steerage companion-way.  Wolf Larsen
  5283	and I, between us, cut off Kerfoot’s crushed finger and sewed up the
  5284	stump.  Mugridge, who, during all the time he had been compelled to cook
  5285	and serve coffee and keep the fire going, had complained of internal
  5286	pains, now swore that he had a broken rib or two.  On examination we
  5287	found that he had three.  But his case was deferred to next day,
  5288	principally for the reason that I did not know anything about broken ribs
  5289	and would first have to read it up.
  5290	
  5291	“I don’t think it was worth it,” I said to Wolf Larsen, “a broken boat
  5292	for Kelly’s life.”
  5293	
  5294	“But Kelly didn’t amount to much,” was the reply.  “Good-night.”
  5295	
  5296	After all that had passed, suffering intolerable anguish in my
  5297	finger-ends, and with three boats missing, to say nothing of the wild
  5298	capers the _Ghost_ was cutting, I should have thought it impossible to
  5299	sleep.  But my eyes must have closed the instant my head touched the
  5300	pillow, and in utter exhaustion I slept throughout the night, the while
  5301	the _Ghost_, lonely and undirected, fought her way through the storm.
  5302	
  5303	
  5304	
  5305	
  5306	CHAPTER XVIII
  5307	
  5308	
  5309	The next day, while the storm was blowing itself out, Wolf Larsen and I
  5310	crammed anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge’s ribs.  Then, when the
  5311	storm broke, Wolf Larsen cruised back and forth over that portion of the
  5312	ocean where we had encountered it, and somewhat more to the westward,
  5313	while the boats were being repaired and new sails made and bent.  Sealing
  5314	schooner after sealing schooner we sighted and boarded, most of which
  5315	were in search of lost boats, and most of which were carrying boats and
  5316	crews they had picked up and which did not belong to them.  For the thick
  5317	of the fleet had been to the westward of us, and the boats, scattered far
  5318	and wide, had headed in mad flight for the nearest refuge.
  5319	
  5320	Two of our boats, with men all safe, we took off the _Cisco_, and, to
  5321	Wolf Larsen’s huge delight and my own grief, he culled Smoke, with Nilson
  5322	and Leach, from the _San Diego_.  So that, at the end of five days, we
  5323	found ourselves short but four men—Henderson, Holyoak, Williams, and
  5324	Kelly,—and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd.
  5325	
  5326	As we followed it north we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs.  Day
  5327	after day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched
  5328	the water, while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and
  5329	every fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun.  Boats were continually being
  5330	lost and found, it being the custom for a boat to hunt, on lay, with
  5331	whatever schooner picked it up, until such time it was recovered by its
  5332	own schooner.  But Wolf Larsen, as was to be expected, being a boat
  5333	short, took possession of the first stray one and compelled its men to
  5334	hunt with the _Ghost_, not permitting them to return to their own
  5335	schooner when we sighted it.  I remember how he forced the hunter and his
  5336	two men below, a riffle at their breasts, when their captain passed by at
  5337	biscuit-toss and hailed us for information.
  5338	
  5339	Thomas Mugridge, so strangely and pertinaciously clinging to life, was
  5340	soon limping about again and performing his double duties of cook and
  5341	cabin-boy.  Johnson and Leach were bullied and beaten as much as ever,
  5342	and they looked for their lives to end with the end of the hunting
  5343	season; while the rest of the crew lived the lives of dogs and were
  5344	worked like dogs by their pitiless master.  As for Wolf Larsen and
  5345	myself, we got along fairly well; though I could not quite rid myself of
  5346	the idea that right conduct, for me, lay in killing him.  He fascinated
  5347	me immeasurably, and I feared him immeasurably.  And yet, I could not
  5348	imagine him lying prone in death.  There was an endurance, as of
  5349	perpetual youth, about him, which rose up and forbade the picture.  I
  5350	could see him only as living always, and dominating always, fighting and
  5351	destroying, himself surviving.
  5352	
  5353	One diversion of his, when we were in the midst of the herd and the sea
  5354	was too rough to lower the boats, was to lower with two boat-pullers and
  5355	a steerer and go out himself.  He was a good shot, too, and brought many
  5356	a skin aboard under what the hunters termed impossible hunting
  5357	conditions.  It seemed the breath of his nostrils, this carrying his life
  5358	in his hands and struggling for it against tremendous odds.
  5359	
  5360	I was learning more and more seamanship; and one clear day—a thing we
  5361	rarely encountered now—I had the satisfaction of running and handling the
  5362	_Ghost_ and picking up the boats myself.  Wolf Larsen had been smitten
  5363	with one of his headaches, and I stood at the wheel from morning until
  5364	evening, sailing across the ocean after the last lee boat, and heaving to
  5365	and picking it and the other five up without command or suggestion from
  5366	him.
  5367	
  5368	Gales we encountered now and again, for it was a raw and stormy region,
  5369	and, in the middle of June, a typhoon most memorable to me and most
  5370	important because of the changes wrought through it upon my future.  We
  5371	must have been caught nearly at the centre of this circular storm, and
  5372	Wolf Larsen ran out of it and to the southward, first under a
  5373	double-reefed jib, and finally under bare poles.  Never had I imagined so
  5374	great a sea.  The seas previously encountered were as ripples compared
  5375	with these, which ran a half-mile from crest to crest and which upreared,
  5376	I am confident, above our masthead.  So great was it that Wolf Larsen
  5377	himself did not dare heave to, though he was being driven far to the
  5378	southward and out of the seal herd.
  5379	
  5380	We must have been well in the path of the trans-Pacific steamships when
  5381	the typhoon moderated, and here, to the surprise of the hunters, we found
  5382	ourselves in the midst of seals—a second herd, or sort of rear-guard,
  5383	they declared, and a most unusual thing.  But it was “Boats over!” the
  5384	boom-boom of guns, and the pitiful slaughter through the long day.
  5385	
  5386	It was at this time that I was approached by Leach.  I had just finished
  5387	tallying the skins of the last boat aboard, when he came to my side, in
  5388	the darkness, and said in a low tone:
  5389	
  5390	“Can you tell me, Mr. Van Weyden, how far we are off the coast, and what
  5391	the bearings of Yokohama are?”
  5392	
  5393	My heart leaped with gladness, for I knew what he had in mind, and I gave
  5394	him the bearings—west-north-west, and five hundred miles away.
  5395	
  5396	“Thank you, sir,” was all he said as he slipped back into the darkness.
  5397	
  5398	Next morning No. 3 boat and Johnson and Leach were missing.  The
  5399	water-breakers and grub-boxes from all the other boats were likewise
  5400	missing, as were the beds and sea bags of the two men.  Wolf Larsen was
  5401	furious.  He set sail and bore away into the west-north-west, two hunters
  5402	constantly at the mastheads and sweeping the sea with glasses, himself
  5403	pacing the deck like an angry lion.  He knew too well my sympathy for the
  5404	runaways to send me aloft as look-out.
  5405	
  5406	The wind was fair but fitful, and it was like looking for a needle in a
  5407	haystack to raise that tiny boat out of the blue immensity.  But he put
  5408	the _Ghost_ through her best paces so as to get between the deserters and
  5409	the land.  This accomplished, he cruised back and forth across what he
  5410	knew must be their course.
  5411	
  5412	On the morning of the third day, shortly after eight bells, a cry that
  5413	the boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead.  All hands
  5414	lined the rail.  A snappy breeze was blowing from the west with the
  5415	promise of more wind behind it; and there, to leeward, in the troubled
  5416	silver of the rising sun, appeared and disappeared a black speck.
  5417	
  5418	We squared away and ran for it.  My heart was as lead.  I felt myself
  5419	turning sick in anticipation; and as I looked at the gleam of triumph in
  5420	Wolf Larsen’s eyes, his form swam before me, and I felt almost
  5421	irresistibly impelled to fling myself upon him.  So unnerved was I by the
  5422	thought of impending violence to Leach and Johnson that my reason must
  5423	have left me.  I know that I slipped down into the steerage in a daze,
  5424	and that I was just beginning the ascent to the deck, a loaded shot-gun
  5425	in my hands, when I heard the startled cry:
  5426	
  5427	“There’s five men in that boat!”
  5428	
  5429	I supported myself in the companion-way, weak and trembling, while the
  5430	observation was being verified by the remarks of the rest of the men.
  5431	Then my knees gave from under me and I sank down, myself again, but
  5432	overcome by shock at knowledge of what I had so nearly done.  Also, I was
  5433	very thankful as I put the gun away and slipped back on deck.
  5434	
  5435	No one had remarked my absence.  The boat was near enough for us to make
  5436	out that it was larger than any sealing boat and built on different
  5437	lines.  As we drew closer, the sail was taken in and the mast unstepped.
  5438	Oars were shipped, and its occupants waited for us to heave to and take
  5439	them aboard.
  5440	
  5441	Smoke, who had descended to the deck and was now standing by my side,
  5442	began to chuckle in a significant way.  I looked at him inquiringly.
  5443	
  5444	“Talk of a mess!” he giggled.
  5445	
  5446	“What’s wrong?” I demanded.
  5447	
  5448	Again he chuckled.  “Don’t you see there, in the stern-sheets, on the
  5449	bottom?  May I never shoot a seal again if that ain’t a woman!”
  5450	
  5451	I looked closely, but was not sure until exclamations broke out on all
  5452	sides.  The boat contained four men, and its fifth occupant was certainly
  5453	a woman.  We were agog with excitement, all except Wolf Larsen, who was
  5454	too evidently disappointed in that it was not his own boat with the two
  5455	victims of his malice.
  5456	
  5457	We ran down the flying jib, hauled the jib-sheets to wind-ward and the
  5458	main-sheet flat, and came up into the wind.  The oars struck the water,
  5459	and with a few strokes the boat was alongside.  I now caught my first
  5460	fair glimpse of the woman.  She was wrapped in a long ulster, for the
  5461	morning was raw; and I could see nothing but her face and a mass of light
  5462	brown hair escaping from under the seaman’s cap on her head.  The eyes
  5463	were large and brown and lustrous, the mouth sweet and sensitive, and the
  5464	face itself a delicate oval, though sun and exposure to briny wind had
  5465	burnt the face scarlet.
  5466	
  5467	She seemed to me like a being from another world.  I was aware of a
  5468	hungry out-reaching for her, as of a starving man for bread.  But then, I
  5469	had not seen a woman for a very long time.  I know that I was lost in a
  5470	great wonder, almost a stupor,—this, then, was a woman?—so that I forgot
  5471	myself and my mate’s duties, and took no part in helping the new-comers
  5472	aboard.  For when one of the sailors lifted her into Wolf Larsen’s
  5473	downstretched arms, she looked up into our curious faces and smiled
  5474	amusedly and sweetly, as only a woman can smile, and as I had seen no one
  5475	smile for so long that I had forgotten such smiles existed.
  5476	
  5477	“Mr. Van Weyden!”
  5478	
  5479	Wolf Larsen’s voice brought me sharply back to myself.
  5480	
  5481	“Will you take the lady below and see to her comfort?  Make up that spare
  5482	port cabin.  Put Cooky to work on it.  And see what you can do for that
  5483	face.  It’s burned badly.”
  5484	
  5485	He turned brusquely away from us and began to question the new men.  The
  5486	boat was cast adrift, though one of them called it a “bloody shame” with
  5487	Yokohama so near.
  5488	
  5489	I found myself strangely afraid of this woman I was escorting aft.  Also
  5490	I was awkward.  It seemed to me that I was realizing for the first time
  5491	what a delicate, fragile creature a woman is; and as I caught her arm to
  5492	help her down the companion stairs, I was startled by its smallness and
  5493	softness.  Indeed, she was a slender, delicate woman as women go, but to
  5494	me she was so ethereally slender and delicate that I was quite prepared
  5495	for her arm to crumble in my grasp.  All this, in frankness, to show my
  5496	first impression, after long denial of women in general and of Maud
  5497	Brewster in particular.
  5498	
  5499	“No need to go to any great trouble for me,” she protested, when I had
  5500	seated her in Wolf Larsen’s arm-chair, which I had dragged hastily from
  5501	his cabin.  “The men were looking for land at any moment this morning,
  5502	and the vessel should be in by night; don’t you think so?”
  5503	
  5504	Her simple faith in the immediate future took me aback.  How could I
  5505	explain to her the situation, the strange man who stalked the sea like
  5506	Destiny, all that it had taken me months to learn?  But I answered
  5507	honestly:
  5508	
  5509	“If it were any other captain except ours, I should say you would be
  5510	ashore in Yokohama to-morrow.  But our captain is a strange man, and I
  5511	beg of you to be prepared for anything—understand?—for anything.”
  5512	
  5513	“I—I confess I hardly do understand,” she hesitated, a perturbed but not
  5514	frightened expression in her eyes.  “Or is it a misconception of mine
  5515	that shipwrecked people are always shown every consideration?  This is
  5516	such a little thing, you know.  We are so close to land.”
  5517	
  5518	“Candidly, I do not know,” I strove to reassure her.  “I wished merely to
  5519	prepare you for the worst, if the worst is to come.  This man, this
  5520	captain, is a brute, a demon, and one can never tell what will be his
  5521	next fantastic act.”
  5522	
  5523	I was growing excited, but she interrupted me with an “Oh, I see,” and
  5524	her voice sounded weary.  To think was patently an effort.  She was
  5525	clearly on the verge of physical collapse.
  5526	
  5527	She asked no further questions, and I vouchsafed no remark, devoting
  5528	myself to Wolf Larsen’s command, which was to make her comfortable.  I
  5529	bustled about in quite housewifely fashion, procuring soothing lotions
  5530	for her sunburn, raiding Wolf Larsen’s private stores for a bottle of
  5531	port I knew to be there, and directing Thomas Mugridge in the preparation
  5532	of the spare state-room.
  5533	
  5534	The wind was freshening rapidly, the _Ghost_ heeling over more and more,
  5535	and by the time the state-room was ready she was dashing through the
  5536	water at a lively clip.  I had quite forgotten the existence of Leach and
  5537	Johnson, when suddenly, like a thunderclap, “Boat ho!” came down the open
  5538	companion-way.  It was Smoke’s unmistakable voice, crying from the
  5539	masthead.  I shot a glance at the woman, but she was leaning back in the
  5540	arm-chair, her eyes closed, unutterably tired.  I doubted that she had
  5541	heard, and I resolved to prevent her seeing the brutality I knew would
  5542	follow the capture of the deserters.  She was tired.  Very good.  She
  5543	should sleep.
  5544	
  5545	There were swift commands on deck, a stamping of feet and a slapping of
  5546	reef-points as the _Ghost_ shot into the wind and about on the other
  5547	tack.  As she filled away and heeled, the arm-chair began to slide across
  5548	the cabin floor, and I sprang for it just in time to prevent the rescued
  5549	woman from being spilled out.
  5550	
  5551	Her eyes were too heavy to suggest more than a hint of the sleepy
  5552	surprise that perplexed her as she looked up at me, and she half
  5553	stumbled, half tottered, as I led her to her cabin.  Mugridge grinned
  5554	insinuatingly in my face as I shoved him out and ordered him back to his
  5555	galley work; and he won his revenge by spreading glowing reports among
  5556	the hunters as to what an excellent “lydy’s-myde” I was proving myself to
  5557	be.
  5558	
  5559	She leaned heavily against me, and I do believe that she had fallen
  5560	asleep again between the arm-chair and the state-room.  This I discovered
  5561	when she nearly fell into the bunk during a sudden lurch of the schooner.
  5562	She aroused, smiled drowsily, and was off to sleep again; and asleep I
  5563	left her, under a heavy pair of sailor’s blankets, her head resting on a
  5564	pillow I had appropriated from Wolf Larsen’s bunk.
  5565	
  5566	
  5567	
  5568	
  5569	CHAPTER XIX
  5570	
  5571	
  5572	I came on deck to find the _Ghost_ heading up close on the port tack and
  5573	cutting in to windward of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same
  5574	tack ahead of us.  All hands were on deck, for they knew that something
  5575	was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.
  5576	
  5577	It was four bells.  Louis came aft to relieve the wheel.  There was a
  5578	dampness in the air, and I noticed he had on his oilskins.
  5579	
  5580	“What are we going to have?” I asked him.
  5581	
  5582	“A healthy young slip of a gale from the breath iv it, sir,” he answered,
  5583	“with a splatter iv rain just to wet our gills an’ no more.”
  5584	
  5585	“Too bad we sighted them,” I said, as the _Ghost’s_ bow was flung off a
  5586	point by a large sea and the boat leaped for a moment past the jibs and
  5587	into our line of vision.
  5588	
  5589	Louis gave a spoke and temporized.  “They’d never iv made the land, sir,
  5590	I’m thinkin’.”
  5591	
  5592	“Think not?” I queried.
  5593	
  5594	“No, sir.  Did you feel that?”  (A puff had caught the schooner, and he
  5595	was forced to put the wheel up rapidly to keep her out of the wind.)
  5596	“’Tis no egg-shell’ll float on this sea an hour come, an’ it’s a stroke
  5597	iv luck for them we’re here to pick ’em up.”
  5598	
  5599	Wolf Larsen strode aft from amidships, where he had been talking with the
  5600	rescued men.  The cat-like springiness in his tread was a little more
  5601	pronounced than usual, and his eyes were bright and snappy.
  5602	
  5603	“Three oilers and a fourth engineer,” was his greeting.  “But we’ll make
  5604	sailors out of them, or boat-pullers at any rate.  Now, what of the
  5605	lady?”
  5606	
  5607	I know not why, but I was aware of a twinge or pang like the cut of a
  5608	knife when he mentioned her.  I thought it a certain silly fastidiousness
  5609	on my part, but it persisted in spite of me, and I merely shrugged my
  5610	shoulders in answer.
  5611	
  5612	Wolf Larsen pursed his lips in a long, quizzical whistle.
  5613	
  5614	“What’s her name, then?” he demanded.
  5615	
  5616	“I don’t know,” I replied.  “She is asleep.  She was very tired.  In
  5617	fact, I am waiting to hear the news from you.  What vessel was it?”
  5618	
  5619	“Mail steamer,” he answered shortly.  “_The City of Tokio_, from ’Frisco,
  5620	bound for Yokohama.  Disabled in that typhoon.  Old tub.  Opened up top
  5621	and bottom like a sieve.  They were adrift four days.  And you don’t know
  5622	who or what she is, eh?—maid, wife, or widow?  Well, well.”
  5623	
  5624	He shook his head in a bantering way, and regarded me with laughing eyes.
  5625	
  5626	“Are you—” I began.  It was on the verge of my tongue to ask if he were
  5627	going to take the castaways into Yokohama.
  5628	
  5629	“Am I what?” he asked.
  5630	
  5631	“What do you intend doing with Leach and Johnson?”
  5632	
  5633	He shook his head.  “Really, Hump, I don’t know.  You see, with these
  5634	additions I’ve about all the crew I want.”
  5635	
  5636	“And they’ve about all the escaping they want,” I said.  “Why not give
  5637	them a change of treatment?  Take them aboard, and deal gently with them.
  5638	Whatever they have done they have been hounded into doing.”
  5639	
  5640	“By me?”
  5641	
  5642	“By you,” I answered steadily.  “And I give you warning, Wolf Larsen,
  5643	that I may forget love of my own life in the desire to kill you if you go
  5644	too far in maltreating those poor wretches.”
  5645	
  5646	“Bravo!” he cried.  “You do me proud, Hump!  You’ve found your legs with
  5647	a vengeance.  You’re quite an individual.  You were unfortunate in having
  5648	your life cast in easy places, but you’re developing, and I like you the
  5649	better for it.”
  5650	
  5651	His voice and expression changed.  His face was serious.  “Do you believe
  5652	in promises?” he asked.  “Are they sacred things?”
  5653	
  5654	“Of course,” I answered.
  5655	
  5656	“Then here’s a compact,” he went on, consummate actor.  “If I promise not
  5657	to lay my hands upon Leach will you promise, in turn, not to attempt to
  5658	kill me?”
  5659	
  5660	“Oh, not that I’m afraid of you, not that I’m afraid of you,” he hastened
  5661	to add.
  5662	
  5663	I could hardly believe my ears.  What was coming over the man?
  5664	
  5665	“Is it a go?” he asked impatiently.
  5666	
  5667	“A go,” I answered.
  5668	
  5669	His hand went out to mine, and as I shook it heartily I could have sworn
  5670	I saw the mocking devil shine up for a moment in his eyes.
  5671	
  5672	We strolled across the poop to the lee side.  The boat was close at hand
  5673	now, and in desperate plight.  Johnson was steering, Leach bailing.  We
  5674	overhauled them about two feet to their one.  Wolf Larsen motioned Louis
  5675	to keep off slightly, and we dashed abreast of the boat, not a score of
  5676	feet to windward.  The _Ghost_ blanketed it.  The spritsail flapped
  5677	emptily and the boat righted to an even keel, causing the two men swiftly
  5678	to change position.  The boat lost headway, and, as we lifted on a huge
  5679	surge, toppled and fell into the trough.
  5680	
  5681	It was at this moment that Leach and Johnson looked up into the faces of
  5682	their shipmates, who lined the rail amidships.  There was no greeting.
  5683	They were as dead men in their comrades’ eyes, and between them was the
  5684	gulf that parts the living and the dead.
  5685	
  5686	The next instant they were opposite the poop, where stood Wolf Larsen and
  5687	I.  We were falling in the trough, they were rising on the surge.
  5688	Johnson looked at me, and I could see that his face was worn and haggard.
  5689	I waved my hand to him, and he answered the greeting, but with a wave
  5690	that was hopeless and despairing.  It was as if he were saying farewell.
  5691	I did not see into the eyes of Leach, for he was looking at Wolf Larsen,
  5692	the old and implacable snarl of hatred strong as ever on his face.
  5693	
  5694	Then they were gone astern.  The spritsail filled with the wind,
  5695	suddenly, careening the frail open craft till it seemed it would surely
  5696	capsize.  A whitecap foamed above it and broke across in a snow-white
  5697	smother.  Then the boat emerged, half swamped, Leach flinging the water
  5698	out and Johnson clinging to the steering-oar, his face white and anxious.
  5699	
  5700	Wolf Larsen barked a short laugh in my ear and strode away to the weather
  5701	side of the poop.  I expected him to give orders for the _Ghost_ to heave
  5702	to, but she kept on her course and he made no sign.  Louis stood
  5703	imperturbably at the wheel, but I noticed the grouped sailors forward
  5704	turning troubled faces in our direction.  Still the _Ghost_ tore along,
  5705	till the boat dwindled to a speck, when Wolf Larsen’s voice rang out in
  5706	command and he went about on the starboard tack.
  5707	
  5708	Back we held, two miles and more to windward of the struggling
  5709	cockle-shell, when the flying jib was run down and the schooner hove to.
  5710	The sealing boats are not made for windward work.  Their hope lies in
  5711	keeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the
  5712	schooner when it breezes up.  But in all that wild waste there was no
  5713	refuge for Leach and Johnson save on the _Ghost_, and they resolutely
  5714	began the windward beat.  It was slow work in the heavy sea that was
  5715	running.  At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing
  5716	combers.  Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff
  5717	into the big whitecaps, lose headway, and be flung back like a cork.
  5718	
  5719	Johnson was a splendid seaman, and he knew as much about small boats as
  5720	he did about ships.  At the end of an hour and a half he was nearly
  5721	alongside, standing past our stern on the last leg out, aiming to fetch
  5722	us on the next leg back.
  5723	
  5724	“So you’ve changed your mind?” I heard Wolf Larsen mutter, half to
  5725	himself, half to them as though they could hear.  “You want to come
  5726	aboard, eh?  Well, then, just keep a-coming.”
  5727	
  5728	“Hard up with that helm!” he commanded Oofty-Oofty, the Kanaka, who had
  5729	in the meantime relieved Louis at the wheel.
  5730	
  5731	Command followed command.  As the schooner paid off, the fore- and
  5732	main-sheets were slacked away for fair wind.  And before the wind we
  5733	were, and leaping, when Johnson, easing his sheet at imminent peril, cut
  5734	across our wake a hundred feet away.  Again Wolf Larsen laughed, at the
  5735	same time beckoning them with his arm to follow.  It was evidently his
  5736	intention to play with them,—a lesson, I took it, in lieu of a beating,
  5737	though a dangerous lesson, for the frail craft stood in momentary danger
  5738	of being overwhelmed.
  5739	
  5740	Johnson squared away promptly and ran after us.  There was nothing else
  5741	for him to do.  Death stalked everywhere, and it was only a matter of
  5742	time when some one of those many huge seas would fall upon the boat, roll
  5743	over it, and pass on.
  5744	
  5745	“’Tis the fear iv death at the hearts iv them,” Louis muttered in my ear,
  5746	as I passed forward to see to taking in the flying jib and staysail.
  5747	
  5748	“Oh, he’ll heave to in a little while and pick them up,” I answered
  5749	cheerfully.  “He’s bent upon giving them a lesson, that’s all.”
  5750	
  5751	Louis looked at me shrewdly.  “Think so?” he asked.
  5752	
  5753	“Surely,” I answered.  “Don’t you?”
  5754	
  5755	“I think nothing but iv my own skin, these days,” was his answer.  “An’
  5756	’tis with wonder I’m filled as to the workin’ out iv things.  A pretty
  5757	mess that ’Frisco whisky got me into, an’ a prettier mess that woman’s
  5758	got you into aft there.  Ah, it’s myself that knows ye for a blitherin’
  5759	fool.”
  5760	
  5761	“What do you mean?” I demanded; for, having sped his shaft, he was
  5762	turning away.
  5763	
  5764	“What do I mean?” he cried.  “And it’s you that asks me!  ’Tis not what I
  5765	mean, but what the Wolf ’ll mean.  The Wolf, I said, the Wolf!”
  5766	
  5767	“If trouble comes, will you stand by?” I asked impulsively, for he had
  5768	voiced my own fear.
  5769	
  5770	“Stand by?  ’Tis old fat Louis I stand by, an’ trouble enough it’ll be.
  5771	We’re at the beginnin’ iv things, I’m tellin’ ye, the bare beginnin’ iv
  5772	things.”
  5773	
  5774	“I had not thought you so great a coward,” I sneered.
  5775	
  5776	He favoured me with a contemptuous stare.  “If I raised never a hand for
  5777	that poor fool,”—pointing astern to the tiny sail,—“d’ye think I’m
  5778	hungerin’ for a broken head for a woman I never laid me eyes upon before
  5779	this day?”
  5780	
  5781	I turned scornfully away and went aft.
  5782	
  5783	“Better get in those topsails, Mr. Van Weyden,” Wolf Larsen said, as I
  5784	came on the poop.
  5785	
  5786	I felt relief, at least as far as the two men were concerned.  It was
  5787	clear he did not wish to run too far away from them.  I picked up hope at
  5788	the thought and put the order swiftly into execution.  I had scarcely
  5789	opened my mouth to issue the necessary commands, when eager men were
  5790	springing to halyards and downhauls, and others were racing aloft.  This
  5791	eagerness on their part was noted by Wolf Larsen with a grim smile.
  5792	
  5793	Still we increased our lead, and when the boat had dropped astern several
  5794	miles we hove to and waited.  All eyes watched it coming, even Wolf
  5795	Larsen’s; but he was the only unperturbed man aboard.  Louis, gazing
  5796	fixedly, betrayed a trouble in his face he was not quite able to hide.
  5797	
  5798	The boat drew closer and closer, hurling along through the seething green
  5799	like a thing alive, lifting and sending and uptossing across the
  5800	huge-backed breakers, or disappearing behind them only to rush into sight
  5801	again and shoot skyward.  It seemed impossible that it could continue to
  5802	live, yet with each dizzying sweep it did achieve the impossible.  A
  5803	rain-squall drove past, and out of the flying wet the boat emerged,
  5804	almost upon us.
  5805	
  5806	“Hard up, there!” Wolf Larsen shouted, himself springing to the wheel and
  5807	whirling it over.
  5808	
  5809	Again the _Ghost_ sprang away and raced before the wind, and for two
  5810	hours Johnson and Leach pursued us.  We hove to and ran away, hove to and
  5811	ran away, and ever astern the struggling patch of sail tossed skyward and
  5812	fell into the rushing valleys.  It was a quarter of a mile away when a
  5813	thick squall of rain veiled it from view.  It never emerged.  The wind
  5814	blew the air clear again, but no patch of sail broke the troubled
  5815	surface.  I thought I saw, for an instant, the boat’s bottom show black
  5816	in a breaking crest.  At the best, that was all.  For Johnson and Leach
  5817	the travail of existence had ceased.
  5818	
  5819	The men remained grouped amidships.  No one had gone below, and no one
  5820	was speaking.  Nor were any looks being exchanged.  Each man seemed
  5821	stunned—deeply contemplative, as it were, and, not quite sure, trying to
  5822	realize just what had taken place.  Wolf Larsen gave them little time for
  5823	thought.  He at once put the _Ghost_ upon her course—a course which meant
  5824	the seal herd and not Yokohama harbour.  But the men were no longer eager
  5825	as they pulled and hauled, and I heard curses amongst them, which left
  5826	their lips smothered and as heavy and lifeless as were they.  Not so was
  5827	it with the hunters.  Smoke the irrepressible related a story, and they
  5828	descended into the steerage, bellowing with laughter.
  5829	
  5830	As I passed to leeward of the galley on my way aft I was approached by
  5831	the engineer we had rescued.  His face was white, his lips were
  5832	trembling.
  5833	
  5834	“Good God! sir, what kind of a craft is this?” he cried.
  5835	
  5836	“You have eyes, you have seen,” I answered, almost brutally, what of the
  5837	pain and fear at my own heart.
  5838	
  5839	“Your promise?” I said to Wolf Larsen.
  5840	
  5841	“I was not thinking of taking them aboard when I made that promise,” he
  5842	answered.  “And anyway, you’ll agree I’ve not laid my hands upon them.”
  5843	
  5844	“Far from it, far from it,” he laughed a moment later.
  5845	
  5846	I made no reply.  I was incapable of speaking, my mind was too confused.
  5847	I must have time to think, I knew.  This woman, sleeping even now in the
  5848	spare cabin, was a responsibility, which I must consider, and the only
  5849	rational thought that flickered through my mind was that I must do
  5850	nothing hastily if I were to be any help to her at all.
  5851	
  5852	
  5853	
  5854	
  5855	CHAPTER XX
  5856	
  5857	
  5858	The remainder of the day passed uneventfully.  The young slip of a gale,
  5859	having wetted our gills, proceeded to moderate.  The fourth engineer and
  5860	the three oilers, after a warm interview with Wolf Larsen, were furnished
  5861	with outfits from the slop-chests, assigned places under the hunters in
  5862	the various boats and watches on the vessel, and bundled forward into the
  5863	forecastle.  They went protestingly, but their voices were not loud.
  5864	They were awed by what they had already seen of Wolf Larsen’s character,
  5865	while the tale of woe they speedily heard in the forecastle took the last
  5866	bit of rebellion out of them.
  5867	
  5868	Miss Brewster—we had learned her name from the engineer—slept on and on.
  5869	At supper I requested the hunters to lower their voices, so she was not
  5870	disturbed; and it was not till next morning that she made her appearance.
  5871	It had been my intention to have her meals served apart, but Wolf Larsen
  5872	put down his foot.  Who was she that she should be too good for cabin
  5873	table and cabin society? had been his demand.
  5874	
  5875	But her coming to the table had something amusing in it.  The hunters
  5876	fell silent as clams.  Jock Horner and Smoke alone were unabashed,
  5877	stealing stealthy glances at her now and again, and even taking part in
  5878	the conversation.  The other four men glued their eyes on their plates
  5879	and chewed steadily and with thoughtful precision, their ears moving and
  5880	wobbling, in time with their jaws, like the ears of so many animals.
  5881	
  5882	Wolf Larsen had little to say at first, doing no more than reply when he
  5883	was addressed.  Not that he was abashed.  Far from it.  This woman was a
  5884	new type to him, a different breed from any he had ever known, and he was
  5885	curious.  He studied her, his eyes rarely leaving her face unless to
  5886	follow the movements of her hands or shoulders.  I studied her myself,
  5887	and though it was I who maintained the conversation, I know that I was a
  5888	bit shy, not quite self-possessed.  His was the perfect poise, the
  5889	supreme confidence in self, which nothing could shake; and he was no more
  5890	timid of a woman than he was of storm and battle.
  5891	
  5892	“And when shall we arrive at Yokohama?” she asked, turning to him and
  5893	looking him squarely in the eyes.
  5894	
  5895	There it was, the question flat.  The jaws stopped working, the ears
  5896	ceased wobbling, and though eyes remained glued on plates, each man
  5897	listened greedily for the answer.
  5898	
  5899	“In four months, possibly three if the season closes early,” Wolf Larsen
  5900	said.
  5901	
  5902	She caught her breath and stammered, “I—I thought—I was given to
  5903	understand that Yokohama was only a day’s sail away.  It—”  Here she
  5904	paused and looked about the table at the circle of unsympathetic faces
  5905	staring hard at the plates.  “It is not right,” she concluded.
  5906	
  5907	“That is a question you must settle with Mr. Van Weyden there,” he
  5908	replied, nodding to me with a mischievous twinkle.  “Mr. Van Weyden is
  5909	what you may call an authority on such things as rights.  Now I, who am
  5910	only a sailor, would look upon the situation somewhat differently.  It
  5911	may possibly be your misfortune that you have to remain with us, but it
  5912	is certainly our good fortune.”
  5913	
  5914	He regarded her smilingly.  Her eyes fell before his gaze, but she lifted
  5915	them again, and defiantly, to mine.  I read the unspoken question there:
  5916	was it right?  But I had decided that the part I was to play must be a
  5917	neutral one, so I did not answer.
  5918	
  5919	“What do you think?” she demanded.
  5920	
  5921	“That it is unfortunate, especially if you have any engagements falling
  5922	due in the course of the next several months.  But, since you say that
  5923	you were voyaging to Japan for your health, I can assure you that it will
  5924	improve no better anywhere than aboard the _Ghost_.”
  5925	
  5926	I saw her eyes flash with indignation, and this time it was I who dropped
  5927	mine, while I felt my face flushing under her gaze.  It was cowardly, but
  5928	what else could I do?
  5929	
  5930	“Mr. Van Weyden speaks with the voice of authority,” Wolf Larsen laughed.
  5931	
  5932	I nodded my head, and she, having recovered herself, waited expectantly.
  5933	
  5934	“Not that he is much to speak of now,” Wolf Larsen went on, “but he has
  5935	improved wonderfully.  You should have seen him when he came on board.  A
  5936	more scrawny, pitiful specimen of humanity one could hardly conceive.
  5937	Isn’t that so, Kerfoot?”
  5938	
  5939	Kerfoot, thus directly addressed, was startled into dropping his knife on
  5940	the floor, though he managed to grunt affirmation.
  5941	
  5942	“Developed himself by peeling potatoes and washing dishes.  Eh, Kerfoot?”
  5943	
  5944	Again that worthy grunted.
  5945	
  5946	“Look at him now.  True, he is not what you would term muscular, but
  5947	still he has muscles, which is more than he had when he came aboard.
  5948	Also, he has legs to stand on.  You would not think so to look at him,
  5949	but he was quite unable to stand alone at first.”
  5950	
  5951	The hunters were snickering, but she looked at me with a sympathy in her
  5952	eyes which more than compensated for Wolf Larsen’s nastiness.  In truth,
  5953	it had been so long since I had received sympathy that I was softened,
  5954	and I became then, and gladly, her willing slave.  But I was angry with
  5955	Wolf Larsen.  He was challenging my manhood with his slurs, challenging
  5956	the very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me.
  5957	
  5958	“I may have learned to stand on my own legs,” I retorted.  “But I have
  5959	yet to stamp upon others with them.”
  5960	
  5961	He looked at me insolently.  “Your education is only half completed,
  5962	then,” he said dryly, and turned to her.
  5963	
  5964	“We are very hospitable upon the _Ghost_.  Mr. Van Weyden has discovered
  5965	that.  We do everything to make our guests feel at home, eh, Mr. Van
  5966	Weyden?”
  5967	
  5968	“Even to the peeling of potatoes and the washing of dishes,” I answered,
  5969	“to say nothing to wringing their necks out of very fellowship.”
  5970	
  5971	“I beg of you not to receive false impressions of us from Mr. Van
  5972	Weyden,” he interposed with mock anxiety.  “You will observe, Miss
  5973	Brewster, that he carries a dirk in his belt, a—ahem—a most unusual thing
  5974	for a ship’s officer to do.  While really very estimable, Mr. Van Weyden
  5975	is sometimes—how shall I say?—er—quarrelsome, and harsh measures are
  5976	necessary.  He is quite reasonable and fair in his calm moments, and as
  5977	he is calm now he will not deny that only yesterday he threatened my
  5978	life.”
  5979	
  5980	I was well-nigh choking, and my eyes were certainly fiery.  He drew
  5981	attention to me.
  5982	
  5983	“Look at him now.  He can scarcely control himself in your presence.  He
  5984	is not accustomed to the presence of ladies anyway.  I shall have to arm
  5985	myself before I dare go on deck with him.”
  5986	
  5987	He shook his head sadly, murmuring, “Too bad, too bad,” while the hunters
  5988	burst into guffaws of laughter.
  5989	
  5990	The deep-sea voices of these men, rumbling and bellowing in the confined
  5991	space, produced a wild effect.  The whole setting was wild, and for the
  5992	first time, regarding this strange woman and realizing how incongruous
  5993	she was in it, I was aware of how much a part of it I was myself.  I knew
  5994	these men and their mental processes, was one of them myself, living the
  5995	seal-hunting life, eating the seal-hunting fare, thinking, largely, the
  5996	seal-hunting thoughts.  There was for me no strangeness to it, to the
  5997	rough clothes, the coarse faces, the wild laughter, and the lurching
  5998	cabin walls and swaying sea-lamps.
  5999	
  6000	As I buttered a piece of bread my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand.  The
  6001	knuckles were skinned and inflamed clear across, the fingers swollen, the
  6002	nails rimmed with black.  I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my
  6003	neck, knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped, that a button was
  6004	missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore.  The dirk mentioned by
  6005	Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip.  It was very natural that it
  6006	should be there,—how natural I had not imagined until now, when I looked
  6007	upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it
  6008	must appear to her.
  6009	
  6010	But she divined the mockery in Wolf Larsen’s words, and again favoured me
  6011	with a sympathetic glance.  But there was a look of bewilderment also in
  6012	her eyes.  That it was mockery made the situation more puzzling to her.
  6013	
  6014	“I may be taken off by some passing vessel, perhaps,” she suggested.
  6015	
  6016	“There will be no passing vessels, except other sealing-schooners,” Wolf
  6017	Larsen made answer.
  6018	
  6019	“I have no clothes, nothing,” she objected.  “You hardly realize, sir,
  6020	that I am not a man, or that I am unaccustomed to the vagrant, careless
  6021	life which you and your men seem to lead.”
  6022	
  6023	“The sooner you get accustomed to it, the better,” he said.
  6024	
  6025	“I’ll furnish you with cloth, needles, and thread,” he added.  “I hope it
  6026	will not be too dreadful a hardship for you to make yourself a dress or
  6027	two.”
  6028	
  6029	She made a wry pucker with her mouth, as though to advertise her
  6030	ignorance of dressmaking.  That she was frightened and bewildered, and
  6031	that she was bravely striving to hide it, was quite plain to me.
  6032	
  6033	“I suppose you’re like Mr. Van Weyden there, accustomed to having things
  6034	done for you.  Well, I think doing a few things for yourself will hardly
  6035	dislocate any joints.  By the way, what do you do for a living?”
  6036	
  6037	She regarded him with amazement unconcealed.
  6038	
  6039	“I mean no offence, believe me.  People eat, therefore they must procure
  6040	the wherewithal.  These men here shoot seals in order to live; for the
  6041	same reason I sail this schooner; and Mr. Van Weyden, for the present at
  6042	any rate, earns his salty grub by assisting me.  Now what do you do?”
  6043	
  6044	She shrugged her shoulders.
  6045	
  6046	“Do you feed yourself?  Or does some one else feed you?”
  6047	
  6048	“I’m afraid some one else has fed me most of my life,” she laughed,
  6049	trying bravely to enter into the spirit of his quizzing, though I could
  6050	see a terror dawning and growing in her eyes as she watched Wolf Larsen.
  6051	
  6052	“And I suppose some one else makes your bed for you?”
  6053	
  6054	“I _have_ made beds,” she replied.
  6055	
  6056	“Very often?”
  6057	
  6058	She shook her head with mock ruefulness.
  6059	
  6060	“Do you know what they do to poor men in the States, who, like you, do
  6061	not work for their living?”
  6062	
  6063	“I am very ignorant,” she pleaded.  “What do they do to the poor men who
  6064	are like me?”
  6065	
  6066	“They send them to jail.  The crime of not earning a living, in their
  6067	case, is called vagrancy.  If I were Mr. Van Weyden, who harps eternally
  6068	on questions of right and wrong, I’d ask, by what right do you live when
  6069	you do nothing to deserve living?”
  6070	
  6071	“But as you are not Mr. Van Weyden, I don’t have to answer, do I?”
  6072	
  6073	She beamed upon him through her terror-filled eyes, and the pathos of it
  6074	cut me to the heart.  I must in some way break in and lead the
  6075	conversation into other channels.
  6076	
  6077	“Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour?” he demanded, certain
  6078	of her answer, a triumphant vindictiveness in his voice.
  6079	
  6080	“Yes, I have,” she answered slowly, and I could have laughed aloud at his
  6081	crestfallen visage.  “I remember my father giving me a dollar once, when
  6082	I was a little girl, for remaining absolutely quiet for five minutes.”
  6083	
  6084	He smiled indulgently.
  6085	
  6086	“But that was long ago,” she continued.  “And you would scarcely demand a
  6087	little girl of nine to earn her own living.”
  6088	
  6089	“At present, however,” she said, after another slight pause, “I earn
  6090	about eighteen hundred dollars a year.”
  6091	
  6092	With one accord, all eyes left the plates and settled on her.  A woman
  6093	who earned eighteen hundred dollars a year was worth looking at.  Wolf
  6094	Larsen was undisguised in his admiration.
  6095	
  6096	“Salary, or piece-work?” he asked.
  6097	
  6098	“Piece-work,” she answered promptly.
  6099	
  6100	“Eighteen hundred,” he calculated.  “That’s a hundred and fifty dollars a
  6101	month.  Well, Miss Brewster, there is nothing small about the _Ghost_.
  6102	Consider yourself on salary during the time you remain with us.”
  6103	
  6104	She made no acknowledgment.  She was too unused as yet to the whims of
  6105	the man to accept them with equanimity.
  6106	
  6107	“I forgot to inquire,” he went on suavely, “as to the nature of your
  6108	occupation.  What commodities do you turn out?  What tools and materials
  6109	do you require?”
  6110	
  6111	“Paper and ink,” she laughed.  “And, oh! also a typewriter.”
  6112	
  6113	“You are Maud Brewster,” I said slowly and with certainty, almost as
  6114	though I were charging her with a crime.
  6115	
  6116	Her eyes lifted curiously to mine.  “How do you know?”
  6117	
  6118	“Aren’t you?” I demanded.
  6119	
  6120	She acknowledged her identity with a nod.  It was Wolf Larsen’s turn to
  6121	be puzzled.  The name and its magic signified nothing to him.  I was
  6122	proud that it did mean something to me, and for the first time in a weary
  6123	while I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him.
  6124	
  6125	“I remember writing a review of a thin little volume—” I had begun
  6126	carelessly, when she interrupted me.
  6127	
  6128	“You!” she cried.  “You are—”
  6129	
  6130	She was now staring at me in wide-eyed wonder.
  6131	
  6132	I nodded my identity, in turn.
  6133	
  6134	“Humphrey Van Weyden,” she concluded; then added with a sigh of relief,
  6135	and unaware that she had glanced that relief at Wolf Larsen, “I am so
  6136	glad.”
  6137	
  6138	“I remember the review,” she went on hastily, becoming aware of the
  6139	awkwardness of her remark; “that too, too flattering review.”
  6140	
  6141	“Not at all,” I denied valiantly.  “You impeach my sober judgment and
  6142	make my canons of little worth.  Besides, all my brother critics were
  6143	with me.  Didn’t Lang include your ‘Kiss Endured’ among the four supreme
  6144	sonnets by women in the English language?”
  6145	
  6146	“But you called me the American Mrs. Meynell!”
  6147	
  6148	“Was it not true?” I demanded.
  6149	
  6150	“No, not that,” she answered.  “I was hurt.”
  6151	
  6152	“We can measure the unknown only by the known,” I replied, in my finest
  6153	academic manner.  “As a critic I was compelled to place you.  You have
  6154	now become a yardstick yourself.  Seven of your thin little volumes are
  6155	on my shelves; and there are two thicker volumes, the essays, which, you
  6156	will pardon my saying, and I know not which is flattered more, fully
  6157	equal your verse.  The time is not far distant when some unknown will
  6158	arise in England and the critics will name her the English Maud
  6159	Brewster.”
  6160	
  6161	“You are very kind, I am sure,” she murmured; and the very
  6162	conventionality of her tones and words, with the host of associations it
  6163	aroused of the old life on the other side of the world, gave me a quick
  6164	thrill—rich with remembrance but stinging sharp with home-sickness.
  6165	
  6166	“And you are Maud Brewster,” I said solemnly, gazing across at her.
  6167	
  6168	“And you are Humphrey Van Weyden,” she said, gazing back at me with equal
  6169	solemnity and awe.  “How unusual!  I don’t understand.  We surely are not
  6170	to expect some wildly romantic sea-story from your sober pen.”
  6171	
  6172	“No, I am not gathering material, I assure you,” was my answer.  “I have
  6173	neither aptitude nor inclination for fiction.”
  6174	
  6175	“Tell me, why have you always buried yourself in California?” she next
  6176	asked.  “It has not been kind of you.  We of the East have seen to very
  6177	little of you—too little, indeed, of the Dean of American Letters, the
  6178	Second.”
  6179	
  6180	I bowed to, and disclaimed, the compliment.  “I nearly met you, once, in
  6181	Philadelphia, some Browning affair or other—you were to lecture, you
  6182	know.  My train was four hours late.”
  6183	
  6184	And then we quite forgot where we were, leaving Wolf Larsen stranded and
  6185	silent in the midst of our flood of gossip.  The hunters left the table
  6186	and went on deck, and still we talked.  Wolf Larsen alone remained.
  6187	Suddenly I became aware of him, leaning back from the table and listening
  6188	curiously to our alien speech of a world he did not know.
  6189	
  6190	I broke short off in the middle of a sentence.  The present, with all its
  6191	perils and anxieties, rushed upon me with stunning force.  It smote Miss
  6192	Brewster likewise, a vague and nameless terror rushing into her eyes as
  6193	she regarded Wolf Larsen.
  6194	
  6195	He rose to his feet and laughed awkwardly.  The sound of it was metallic.
  6196	
  6197	“Oh, don’t mind me,” he said, with a self-depreciatory wave of his hand.
  6198	“I don’t count.  Go on, go on, I pray you.”
  6199	
  6200	But the gates of speech were closed, and we, too, rose from the table and
  6201	laughed awkwardly.

  6206	CHAPTER XXI
  6207	
  6208	
  6209	The chagrin Wolf Larsen felt from being ignored by Maud Brewster and me
  6210	in the conversation at table had to express itself in some fashion, and
  6211	it fell to Thomas Mugridge to be the victim.  He had not mended his ways
  6212	nor his shirt, though the latter he contended he had changed.  The
  6213	garment itself did not bear out the assertion, nor did the accumulations
  6214	of grease on stove and pot and pan attest a general cleanliness.
  6215	
  6216	“I’ve given you warning, Cooky,” Wolf Larsen said, “and now you’ve got to
  6217	take your medicine.”
  6218	
  6219	Mugridge’s face turned white under its sooty veneer, and when Wolf Larsen
  6220	called for a rope and a couple of men, the miserable Cockney fled wildly
  6221	out of the galley and dodged and ducked about the deck with the grinning
  6222	crew in pursuit.  Few things could have been more to their liking than to
  6223	give him a tow over the side, for to the forecastle he had sent messes
  6224	and concoctions of the vilest order.  Conditions favoured the
  6225	undertaking.  The _Ghost_ was slipping through the water at no more than
  6226	three miles an hour, and the sea was fairly calm.  But Mugridge had
  6227	little stomach for a dip in it.  Possibly he had seen men towed before.
  6228	Besides, the water was frightfully cold, and his was anything but a
  6229	rugged constitution.
  6230	
  6231	As usual, the watches below and the hunters turned out for what promised
  6232	sport.  Mugridge seemed to be in rabid fear of the water, and he
  6233	exhibited a nimbleness and speed we did not dream he possessed.  Cornered
  6234	in the right-angle of the poop and galley, he sprang like a cat to the
  6235	top of the cabin and ran aft.  But his pursuers forestalling him, he
  6236	doubled back across the cabin, passed over the galley, and gained the
  6237	deck by means of the steerage-scuttle.  Straight forward he raced, the
  6238	boat-puller Harrison at his heels and gaining on him.  But Mugridge,
  6239	leaping suddenly, caught the jib-boom-lift.  It happened in an instant.
  6240	Holding his weight by his arms, and in mid-air doubling his body at the
  6241	hips, he let fly with both feet.  The oncoming Harrison caught the kick
  6242	squarely in the pit of the stomach, groaned involuntarily, and doubled up
  6243	and sank backward to the deck.
  6244	
  6245	Hand-clapping and roars of laughter from the hunters greeted the exploit,
  6246	while Mugridge, eluding half of his pursuers at the foremast, ran aft and
  6247	through the remainder like a runner on the football field.  Straight aft
  6248	he held, to the poop and along the poop to the stern.  So great was his
  6249	speed that as he curved past the corner of the cabin he slipped and fell.
  6250	Nilson was standing at the wheel, and the Cockney’s hurtling body struck
  6251	his legs.  Both went down together, but Mugridge alone arose.  By some
  6252	freak of pressures, his frail body had snapped the strong man’s leg like
  6253	a pipe-stem.
  6254	
  6255	Parsons took the wheel, and the pursuit continued.  Round and round the
  6256	decks they went, Mugridge sick with fear, the sailors hallooing and
  6257	shouting directions to one another, and the hunters bellowing
  6258	encouragement and laughter.  Mugridge went down on the fore-hatch under
  6259	three men; but he emerged from the mass like an eel, bleeding at the
  6260	mouth, the offending shirt ripped into tatters, and sprang for the
  6261	main-rigging.  Up he went, clear up, beyond the ratlines, to the very
  6262	masthead.
  6263	
  6264	Half-a-dozen sailors swarmed to the crosstrees after him, where they
  6265	clustered and waited while two of their number, Oofty-Oofty and Black
  6266	(who was Latimer’s boat-steerer), continued up the thin steel stays,
  6267	lifting their bodies higher and higher by means of their arms.
  6268	
  6269	It was a perilous undertaking, for, at a height of over a hundred feet
  6270	from the deck, holding on by their hands, they were not in the best of
  6271	positions to protect themselves from Mugridge’s feet.  And Mugridge
  6272	kicked savagely, till the Kanaka, hanging on with one hand, seized the
  6273	Cockney’s foot with the other.  Black duplicated the performance a moment
  6274	later with the other foot.  Then the three writhed together in a swaying
  6275	tangle, struggling, sliding, and falling into the arms of their mates on
  6276	the crosstrees.
  6277	
  6278	The aërial battle was over, and Thomas Mugridge, whining and gibbering,
  6279	his mouth flecked with bloody foam, was brought down to deck.  Wolf
  6280	Larsen rove a bowline in a piece of rope and slipped it under his
  6281	shoulders.  Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea.
  6282	Forty,—fifty,—sixty feet of line ran out, when Wolf Larsen cried “Belay!”
  6283	Oofty-Oofty took a turn on a bitt, the rope tautened, and the _Ghost_,
  6284	lunging onward, jerked the cook to the surface.
  6285	
  6286	It was a pitiful spectacle.  Though he could not drown, and was
  6287	nine-lived in addition, he was suffering all the agonies of
  6288	half-drowning.  The _Ghost_ was going very slowly, and when her stern
  6289	lifted on a wave and she slipped forward she pulled the wretch to the
  6290	surface and gave him a moment in which to breathe; but between each lift
  6291	the stern fell, and while the bow lazily climbed the next wave the line
  6292	slacked and he sank beneath.
  6293	
  6294	I had forgotten the existence of Maud Brewster, and I remembered her with
  6295	a start as she stepped lightly beside me.  It was her first time on deck
  6296	since she had come aboard.  A dead silence greeted her appearance.
  6297	
  6298	“What is the cause of the merriment?” she asked.
  6299	
  6300	“Ask Captain Larsen,” I answered composedly and coldly, though inwardly
  6301	my blood was boiling at the thought that she should be witness to such
  6302	brutality.
  6303	
  6304	She took my advice and was turning to put it into execution, when her
  6305	eyes lighted on Oofty-Oofty, immediately before her, his body instinct
  6306	with alertness and grace as he held the turn of the rope.
  6307	
  6308	“Are you fishing?” she asked him.
  6309	
  6310	He made no reply.  His eyes, fixed intently on the sea astern, suddenly
  6311	flashed.
  6312	
  6313	“Shark ho, sir!” he cried.
  6314	
  6315	“Heave in!  Lively!  All hands tail on!” Wolf Larsen shouted, springing
  6316	himself to the rope in advance of the quickest.
  6317	
  6318	Mugridge had heard the Kanaka’s warning cry and was screaming madly.  I
  6319	could see a black fin cutting the water and making for him with greater
  6320	swiftness than he was being pulled aboard.  It was an even toss whether
  6321	the shark or we would get him, and it was a matter of moments.  When
  6322	Mugridge was directly beneath us, the stern descended the slope of a
  6323	passing wave, thus giving the advantage to the shark.  The fin
  6324	disappeared.  The belly flashed white in swift upward rush.  Almost
  6325	equally swift, but not quite, was Wolf Larsen.  He threw his strength
  6326	into one tremendous jerk.  The Cockney’s body left the water; so did part
  6327	of the shark’s.  He drew up his legs, and the man-eater seemed no more
  6328	than barely to touch one foot, sinking back into the water with a splash.
  6329	But at the moment of contact Thomas Mugridge cried out.  Then he came in
  6330	like a fresh-caught fish on a line, clearing the rail generously and
  6331	striking the deck in a heap, on hands and knees, and rolling over.
  6332	
  6333	But a fountain of blood was gushing forth.  The right foot was missing,
  6334	amputated neatly at the ankle.  I looked instantly to Maud Brewster.  Her
  6335	face was white, her eyes dilated with horror.  She was gazing, not at
  6336	Thomas Mugridge, but at Wolf Larsen.  And he was aware of it, for he
  6337	said, with one of his short laughs:
  6338	
  6339	“Man-play, Miss Brewster.  Somewhat rougher, I warrant, than what you
  6340	have been used to, but still-man-play.  The shark was not in the
  6341	reckoning.  It—”
  6342	
  6343	But at this juncture, Mugridge, who had lifted his head and ascertained
  6344	the extent of his loss, floundered over on the deck and buried his teeth
  6345	in Wolf Larsen’s leg.  Wolf Larsen stooped, coolly, to the Cockney, and
  6346	pressed with thumb and finger at the rear of the jaws and below the ears.
  6347	The jaws opened with reluctance, and Wolf Larsen stepped free.
  6348	
  6349	“As I was saying,” he went on, as though nothing unwonted had happened,
  6350	“the shark was not in the reckoning.  It was—ahem—shall we say
  6351	Providence?”
  6352	
  6353	She gave no sign that she had heard, though the expression of her eyes
  6354	changed to one of inexpressible loathing as she started to turn away.
  6355	She no more than started, for she swayed and tottered, and reached her
  6356	hand weakly out to mine.  I caught her in time to save her from falling,
  6357	and helped her to a seat on the cabin.  I thought she might faint
  6358	outright, but she controlled herself.
  6359	
  6360	“Will you get a tourniquet, Mr. Van Weyden,” Wolf Larsen called to me.
  6361	
  6362	I hesitated.  Her lips moved, and though they formed no words, she
  6363	commanded me with her eyes, plainly as speech, to go to the help of the
  6364	unfortunate man.  “Please,” she managed to whisper, and I could but obey.
  6365	
  6366	By now I had developed such skill at surgery that Wolf Larsen, with a few
  6367	words of advice, left me to my task with a couple of sailors for
  6368	assistants.  For his task he elected a vengeance on the shark.  A heavy
  6369	swivel-hook, baited with fat salt-pork, was dropped overside; and by the
  6370	time I had compressed the severed veins and arteries, the sailors were
  6371	singing and heaving in the offending monster.  I did not see it myself,
  6372	but my assistants, first one and then the other, deserted me for a few
  6373	moments to run amidships and look at what was going on.  The shark, a
  6374	sixteen-footer, was hoisted up against the main-rigging.  Its jaws were
  6375	pried apart to their greatest extension, and a stout stake, sharpened at
  6376	both ends, was so inserted that when the pries were removed the spread
  6377	jaws were fixed upon it.  This accomplished, the hook was cut out.  The
  6378	shark dropped back into the sea, helpless, yet with its full strength,
  6379	doomed—to lingering starvation—a living death less meet for it than for
  6380	the man who devised the punishment.
  6381	
  6382	
  6383	
  6384	
  6385	CHAPTER XXII
  6386	
  6387	
  6388	I knew what it was as she came toward me.  For ten minutes I had watched
  6389	her talking earnestly with the engineer, and now, with a sign for
  6390	silence, I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman.  Her face was white
  6391	and set; her large eyes, larger than usual what of the purpose in them,
  6392	looked penetratingly into mine.  I felt rather timid and apprehensive,
  6393	for she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden’s soul, and Humphrey Van
  6394	Weyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on
  6395	the _Ghost_.
  6396	
  6397	We walked to the break of the poop, where she turned and faced me.  I
  6398	glanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance.
  6399	
  6400	“What is it?” I asked gently; but the expression of determination on her
  6401	face did not relax.
  6402	
  6403	“I can readily understand,” she began, “that this morning’s affair was
  6404	largely an accident; but I have been talking with Mr. Haskins.  He tells
  6405	me that the day we were rescued, even while I was in the cabin, two men
  6406	were drowned, deliberately drowned—murdered.”
  6407	
  6408	There was a query in her voice, and she faced me accusingly, as though I
  6409	were guilty of the deed, or at least a party to it.
  6410	
  6411	“The information is quite correct,” I answered.  “The two men were
  6412	murdered.”
  6413	
  6414	“And you permitted it!” she cried.
  6415	
  6416	“I was unable to prevent it, is a better way of phrasing it,” I replied,
  6417	still gently.
  6418	
  6419	“But you tried to prevent it?”  There was an emphasis on the “tried,” and
  6420	a pleading little note in her voice.
  6421	
  6422	“Oh, but you didn’t,” she hurried on, divining my answer.  “But why
  6423	didn’t you?”
  6424	
  6425	I shrugged my shoulders.  “You must remember, Miss Brewster, that you are
  6426	a new inhabitant of this little world, and that you do not yet understand
  6427	the laws which operate within it.  You bring with you certain fine
  6428	conceptions of humanity, manhood, conduct, and such things; but here you
  6429	will find them misconceptions.  I have found it so,” I added, with an
  6430	involuntary sigh.
  6431	
  6432	She shook her head incredulously.
  6433	
  6434	“What would you advise, then?” I asked.  “That I should take a knife, or
  6435	a gun, or an axe, and kill this man?”
  6436	
  6437	She half started back.
  6438	
  6439	“No, not that!”
  6440	
  6441	“Then what should I do?  Kill myself?”
  6442	
  6443	“You speak in purely materialistic terms,” she objected.  “There is such
  6444	a thing as moral courage, and moral courage is never without effect.”
  6445	
  6446	“Ah,” I smiled, “you advise me to kill neither him nor myself, but to let
  6447	him kill me.”  I held up my hand as she was about to speak.  “For moral
  6448	courage is a worthless asset on this little floating world.  Leach, one
  6449	of the men who were murdered, had moral courage to an unusual degree.  So
  6450	had the other man, Johnson.  Not only did it not stand them in good
  6451	stead, but it destroyed them.  And so with me if I should exercise what
  6452	little moral courage I may possess.
  6453	
  6454	“You must understand, Miss Brewster, and understand clearly, that this
  6455	man is a monster.  He is without conscience.  Nothing is sacred to him,
  6456	nothing is too terrible for him to do.  It was due to his whim that I was
  6457	detained aboard in the first place.  It is due to his whim that I am
  6458	still alive.  I do nothing, can do nothing, because I am a slave to this
  6459	monster, as you are now a slave to him; because I desire to live, as you
  6460	will desire to live; because I cannot fight and overcome him, just as you
  6461	will not be able to fight and overcome him.”
  6462	
  6463	She waited for me to go on.
  6464	
  6465	“What remains?  Mine is the role of the weak.  I remain silent and suffer
  6466	ignominy, as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy.  And it is well.
  6467	It is the best we can do if we wish to live.  The battle is not always to
  6468	the strong.  We have not the strength with which to fight this man; we
  6469	must dissimulate, and win, if win we can, by craft.  If you will be
  6470	advised by me, this is what you will do.  I know my position is perilous,
  6471	and I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous.  We must stand
  6472	together, without appearing to do so, in secret alliance.  I shall not be
  6473	able to side with you openly, and, no matter what indignities may be put
  6474	upon me, you are to remain likewise silent.  We must provoke no scenes
  6475	with this man, nor cross his will.  And we must keep smiling faces and be
  6476	friendly with him no matter how repulsive it may be.”
  6477	
  6478	She brushed her hand across her forehead in a puzzled way, saying, “Still
  6479	I do not understand.”
  6480	
  6481	“You must do as I say,” I interrupted authoritatively, for I saw Wolf
  6482	Larsen’s gaze wandering toward us from where he paced up and down with
  6483	Latimer amidships.  “Do as I say, and ere long you will find I am right.”
  6484	
  6485	“What shall I do, then?” she asked, detecting the anxious glance I had
  6486	shot at the object of our conversation, and impressed, I flatter myself,
  6487	with the earnestness of my manner.
  6488	
  6489	“Dispense with all the moral courage you can,” I said briskly.  “Don’t
  6490	arouse this man’s animosity.  Be quite friendly with him, talk with him,
  6491	discuss literature and art with him—he is fond of such things.  You will
  6492	find him an interested listener and no fool.  And for your own sake try
  6493	to avoid witnessing, as much as you can, the brutalities of the ship.  It
  6494	will make it easier for you to act your part.”
  6495	
  6496	“I am to lie,” she said in steady, rebellious tones, “by speech and
  6497	action to lie.”
  6498	
  6499	Wolf Larsen had separated from Latimer and was coming toward us.  I was
  6500	desperate.
  6501	
  6502	“Please, please understand me,” I said hurriedly, lowering my voice.
  6503	“All your experience of men and things is worthless here.  You must begin
  6504	over again.  I know,—I can see it—you have, among other ways, been used
  6505	to managing people with your eyes, letting your moral courage speak out
  6506	through them, as it were.  You have already managed me with your eyes,
  6507	commanded me with them.  But don’t try it on Wolf Larsen.  You could as
  6508	easily control a lion, while he would make a mock of you.  He would—I
  6509	have always been proud of the fact that I discovered him,” I said,
  6510	turning the conversation as Wolf Larsen stepped on the poop and joined
  6511	us.  “The editors were afraid of him and the publishers would have none
  6512	of him.  But I knew, and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when
  6513	he made that magnificent hit with his ‘Forge.’”
  6514	
  6515	“And it was a newspaper poem,” she said glibly.
  6516	
  6517	“It did happen to see the light in a newspaper,” I replied, “but not
  6518	because the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it.”
  6519	
  6520	“We were talking of Harris,” I said to Wolf Larsen.
  6521	
  6522	“Oh, yes,” he acknowledged.  “I remember the ‘Forge.’  Filled with pretty
  6523	sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions.  By the way, Mr. Van
  6524	Weyden, you’d better look in on Cooky.  He’s complaining and restless.”
  6525	
  6526	Thus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop, only to find Mugridge
  6527	sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him.  I made no haste to
  6528	return on deck, and when I did I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in
  6529	animated conversation with Wolf Larsen.  As I say, the sight gratified
  6530	me.  She was following my advice.  And yet I was conscious of a slight
  6531	shock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do
  6532	and which she had notably disliked.
  6533	
  6534	
  6535	
  6536	
  6537	CHAPTER XXIII
  6538	
  6539	
  6540	Brave winds, blowing fair, swiftly drove the _Ghost_ northward into the
  6541	seal herd.  We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth parallel, in a
  6542	raw and stormy sea across which the wind harried the fog-banks in eternal
  6543	flight.  For days at a time we could never see the sun nor take an
  6544	observation; then the wind would sweep the face of the ocean clean, the
  6545	waves would ripple and flash, and we would learn where we were.  A day of
  6546	clear weather might follow, or three days or four, and then the fog would
  6547	settle down upon us, seemingly thicker than ever.
  6548	
  6549	The hunting was perilous; yet the boats, lowered day after day, were
  6550	swallowed up in the grey obscurity, and were seen no more till nightfall,
  6551	and often not till long after, when they would creep in like sea-wraiths,
  6552	one by one, out of the grey.  Wainwright—the hunter whom Wolf Larsen had
  6553	stolen with boat and men—took advantage of the veiled sea and escaped.
  6554	He disappeared one morning in the encircling fog with his two men, and we
  6555	never saw them again, though it was not many days when we learned that
  6556	they had passed from schooner to schooner until they finally regained
  6557	their own.
  6558	
  6559	This was the thing I had set my mind upon doing, but the opportunity
  6560	never offered.  It was not in the mate’s province to go out in the boats,
  6561	and though I manœuvred cunningly for it, Wolf Larsen never granted me the
  6562	privilege.  Had he done so, I should have managed somehow to carry Miss
  6563	Brewster away with me.  As it was, the situation was approaching a stage
  6564	which I was afraid to consider.  I involuntarily shunned the thought of
  6565	it, and yet the thought continually arose in my mind like a haunting
  6566	spectre.
  6567	
  6568	I had read sea-romances in my time, wherein figured, as a matter of
  6569	course, the lone woman in the midst of a shipload of men; but I learned,
  6570	now, that I had never comprehended the deeper significance of such a
  6571	situation—the thing the writers harped upon and exploited so thoroughly.
  6572	And here it was, now, and I was face to face with it.  That it should be
  6573	as vital as possible, it required no more than that the woman should be
  6574	Maud Brewster, who now charmed me in person as she had long charmed me
  6575	through her work.
  6576	
  6577	No one more out of environment could be imagined.  She was a delicate,
  6578	ethereal creature, swaying and willowy, light and graceful of movement.
  6579	It never seemed to me that she walked, or, at least, walked after the
  6580	ordinary manner of mortals.  Hers was an extreme lithesomeness, and she
  6581	moved with a certain indefinable airiness, approaching one as down might
  6582	float or as a bird on noiseless wings.
  6583	
  6584	She was like a bit of Dresden china, and I was continually impressed with
  6585	what I may call her fragility.  As at the time I caught her arm when
  6586	helping her below, so at any time I was quite prepared, should stress or
  6587	rough handling befall her, to see her crumble away.  I have never seen
  6588	body and spirit in such perfect accord.  Describe her verse, as the
  6589	critics have described it, as sublimated and spiritual, and you have
  6590	described her body.  It seemed to partake of her soul, to have analogous
  6591	attributes, and to link it to life with the slenderest of chains.
  6592	Indeed, she trod the earth lightly, and in her constitution there was
  6593	little of the robust clay.
  6594	
  6595	She was in striking contrast to Wolf Larsen.  Each was nothing that the
  6596	other was, everything that the other was not.  I noted them walking the
  6597	deck together one morning, and I likened them to the extreme ends of the
  6598	human ladder of evolution—the one the culmination of all savagery, the
  6599	other the finished product of the finest civilization.  True, Wolf Larsen
  6600	possessed intellect to an unusual degree, but it was directed solely to
  6601	the exercise of his savage instincts and made him but the more formidable
  6602	a savage.  He was splendidly muscled, a heavy man, and though he strode
  6603	with the certitude and directness of the physical man, there was nothing
  6604	heavy about his stride.  The jungle and the wilderness lurked in the
  6605	uplift and downput of his feet.  He was cat-footed, and lithe, and
  6606	strong, always strong.  I likened him to some great tiger, a beast of
  6607	prowess and prey.  He looked it, and the piercing glitter that arose at
  6608	times in his eyes was the same piercing glitter I had observed in the
  6609	eyes of caged leopards and other preying creatures of the wild.
  6610	
  6611	But this day, as I noted them pacing up and down, I saw that it was she
  6612	who terminated the walk.  They came up to where I was standing by the
  6613	entrance to the companion-way.  Though she betrayed it by no outward
  6614	sign, I felt, somehow, that she was greatly perturbed.  She made some
  6615	idle remark, looking at me, and laughed lightly enough; but I saw her
  6616	eyes return to his, involuntarily, as though fascinated; then they fell,
  6617	but not swiftly enough to veil the rush of terror that filled them.
  6618	
  6619	It was in his eyes that I saw the cause of her perturbation.  Ordinarily
  6620	grey and cold and harsh, they were now warm and soft and golden, and all
  6621	a-dance with tiny lights that dimmed and faded, or welled up till the
  6622	full orbs were flooded with a glowing radiance.  Perhaps it was to this
  6623	that the golden colour was due; but golden his eyes were, enticing and
  6624	masterful, at the same time luring and compelling, and speaking a demand
  6625	and clamour of the blood which no woman, much less Maud Brewster, could
  6626	misunderstand.
  6627	
  6628	Her own terror rushed upon me, and in that moment of fear—the most
  6629	terrible fear a man can experience—I knew that in inexpressible ways she
  6630	was dear to me.  The knowledge that I loved her rushed upon me with the
  6631	terror, and with both emotions gripping at my heart and causing my blood
  6632	at the same time to chill and to leap riotously, I felt myself drawn by a
  6633	power without me and beyond me, and found my eyes returning against my
  6634	will to gaze into the eyes of Wolf Larsen.  But he had recovered himself.
  6635	The golden colour and the dancing lights were gone.  Cold and grey and
  6636	glittering they were as he bowed brusquely and turned away.
  6637	
  6638	“I am afraid,” she whispered, with a shiver.  “I am so afraid.”
  6639	
  6640	I, too, was afraid, and what of my discovery of how much she meant to me
  6641	my mind was in a turmoil; but, I succeeded in answering quite calmly:
  6642	
  6643	“All will come right, Miss Brewster.  Trust me, it will come right.”
  6644	
  6645	She answered with a grateful little smile that sent my heart pounding,
  6646	and started to descend the companion-stairs.
  6647	
  6648	For a long while I remained standing where she had left me.  There was
  6649	imperative need to adjust myself, to consider the significance of the
  6650	changed aspect of things.  It had come, at last, love had come, when I
  6651	least expected it and under the most forbidding conditions.  Of course,
  6652	my philosophy had always recognized the inevitableness of the love-call
  6653	sooner or later; but long years of bookish silence had made me
  6654	inattentive and unprepared.
  6655	
  6656	And now it had come!  Maud Brewster!  My memory flashed back to that
  6657	first thin little volume on my desk, and I saw before me, as though in
  6658	the concrete, the row of thin little volumes on my library shelf.  How I
  6659	had welcomed each of them!  Each year one had come from the press, and to
  6660	me each was the advent of the year.  They had voiced a kindred intellect
  6661	and spirit, and as such I had received them into a camaraderie of the
  6662	mind; but now their place was in my heart.
  6663	
  6664	My heart?  A revulsion of feeling came over me.  I seemed to stand
  6665	outside myself and to look at myself incredulously.  Maud Brewster!
  6666	Humphrey Van Weyden, “the cold-blooded fish,” the “emotionless monster,”
  6667	the “analytical demon,” of Charley Furuseth’s christening, in love!  And
  6668	then, without rhyme or reason, all sceptical, my mind flew back to a
  6669	small biographical note in the red-bound _Who’s Who_, and I said to
  6670	myself, “She was born in Cambridge, and she is twenty-seven years old.”
  6671	And then I said, “Twenty-seven years old and still free and fancy free?”
  6672	But how did I know she was fancy free?  And the pang of new-born jealousy
  6673	put all incredulity to flight.  There was no doubt about it.  I was
  6674	jealous; therefore I loved.  And the woman I loved was Maud Brewster.
  6675	
  6676	I, Humphrey Van Weyden, was in love!  And again the doubt assailed me.
  6677	Not that I was afraid of it, however, or reluctant to meet it.  On the
  6678	contrary, idealist that I was to the most pronounced degree, my
  6679	philosophy had always recognized and guerdoned love as the greatest thing
  6680	in the world, the aim and the summit of being, the most exquisite pitch
  6681	of joy and happiness to which life could thrill, the thing of all things
  6682	to be hailed and welcomed and taken into the heart.  But now that it had
  6683	come I could not believe.  I could not be so fortunate.  It was too good,
  6684	too good to be true.  Symons’s lines came into my head:
  6685	
  6686	   “I wandered all these years among
  6687	   A world of women, seeking you.”
  6688	
  6689	And then I had ceased seeking.  It was not for me, this greatest thing in
  6690	the world, I had decided.  Furuseth was right; I was abnormal, an
  6691	“emotionless monster,” a strange bookish creature, capable of pleasuring
  6692	in sensations only of the mind.  And though I had been surrounded by
  6693	women all my days, my appreciation of them had been æsthetic and nothing
  6694	more.  I had actually, at times, considered myself outside the pale, a
  6695	monkish fellow denied the eternal or the passing passions I saw and
  6696	understood so well in others.  And now it had come!  Undreamed of and
  6697	unheralded, it had come.  In what could have been no less than an
  6698	ecstasy, I left my post at the head of the companion-way and started
  6699	along the deck, murmuring to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs.
  6700	Browning:
  6701	
  6702	   “I lived with visions for my company
  6703	   Instead of men and women years ago,
  6704	   And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
  6705	   A sweeter music than they played to me.”
  6706	
  6707	But the sweeter music was playing in my ears, and I was blind and
  6708	oblivious to all about me.  The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
  6709	
  6710	“What the hell are you up to?” he was demanding.
  6711	
  6712	I had strayed forward where the sailors were painting, and I came to
  6713	myself to find my advancing foot on the verge of overturning a paint-pot.
  6714	
  6715	“Sleep-walking, sunstroke,—what?” he barked.
  6716	
  6717	“No; indigestion,” I retorted, and continued my walk as if nothing
  6718	untoward had occurred.
  6719	
  6720	
  6721	
  6722	
  6723	CHAPTER XXIV
  6724	
  6725	
  6726	Among the most vivid memories of my life are those of the events on the
  6727	_Ghost_ which occurred during the forty hours succeeding the discovery of
  6728	my love for Maud Brewster.  I, who had lived my life in quiet places,
  6729	only to enter at the age of thirty-five upon a course of the most
  6730	irrational adventure I could have imagined, never had more incident and
  6731	excitement crammed into any forty hours of my experience.  Nor can I
  6732	quite close my ears to a small voice of pride which tells me I did not do
  6733	so badly, all things considered.
  6734	
  6735	To begin with, at the midday dinner, Wolf Larsen informed the hunters
  6736	that they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage.  It was an
  6737	unprecedented thing on sealing-schooners, where it is the custom for the
  6738	hunters to rank, unofficially as officers.  He gave no reason, but his
  6739	motive was obvious enough.  Horner and Smoke had been displaying a
  6740	gallantry toward Maud Brewster, ludicrous in itself and inoffensive to
  6741	her, but to him evidently distasteful.
  6742	
  6743	The announcement was received with black silence, though the other four
  6744	hunters glanced significantly at the two who had been the cause of their
  6745	banishment.  Jock Horner, quiet as was his way, gave no sign; but the
  6746	blood surged darkly across Smoke’s forehead, and he half opened his mouth
  6747	to speak.  Wolf Larsen was watching him, waiting for him, the steely
  6748	glitter in his eyes; but Smoke closed his mouth again without having said
  6749	anything.
  6750	
  6751	“Anything to say?” the other demanded aggressively.
  6752	
  6753	It was a challenge, but Smoke refused to accept it.
  6754	
  6755	“About what?” he asked, so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted,
  6756	while the others smiled.
  6757	
  6758	“Oh, nothing,” Wolf Larsen said lamely.  “I just thought you might want
  6759	to register a kick.”
  6760	
  6761	“About what?” asked the imperturbable Smoke.
  6762	
  6763	Smoke’s mates were now smiling broadly.  His captain could have killed
  6764	him, and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not Maud Brewster
  6765	been present.  For that matter, it was her presence which enabled Smoke
  6766	to act as he did.  He was too discreet and cautious a man to incur Wolf
  6767	Larsen’s anger at a time when that anger could be expressed in terms
  6768	stronger than words.  I was in fear that a struggle might take place, but
  6769	a cry from the helmsman made it easy for the situation to save itself.
  6770	
  6771	“Smoke ho!” the cry came down the open companion-way.
  6772	
  6773	“How’s it bear?” Wolf Larsen called up.
  6774	
  6775	“Dead astern, sir.”
  6776	
  6777	“Maybe it’s a Russian,” suggested Latimer.
  6778	
  6779	His words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters.  A Russian
  6780	could mean but one thing—a cruiser.  The hunters, never more than roughly
  6781	aware of the position of the ship, nevertheless knew that we were close
  6782	to the boundaries of the forbidden sea, while Wolf Larsen’s record as a
  6783	poacher was notorious.  All eyes centred upon him.
  6784	
  6785	“We’re dead safe,” he assured them with a laugh.  “No salt mines this
  6786	time, Smoke.  But I’ll tell you what—I’ll lay odds of five to one it’s
  6787	the _Macedonia_.”
  6788	
  6789	No one accepted his offer, and he went on: “In which event, I’ll lay ten
  6790	to one there’s trouble breezing up.”
  6791	
  6792	“No, thank you,” Latimer spoke up.  “I don’t object to losing my money,
  6793	but I like to get a run for it anyway.  There never was a time when there
  6794	wasn’t trouble when you and that brother of yours got together, and I’ll
  6795	lay twenty to one on that.”
  6796	
  6797	A general smile followed, in which Wolf Larsen joined, and the dinner
  6798	went on smoothly, thanks to me, for he treated me abominably the rest of
  6799	the meal, sneering at me and patronizing me till I was all a-tremble with
  6800	suppressed rage.  Yet I knew I must control myself for Maud Brewster’s
  6801	sake, and I received my reward when her eyes caught mine for a fleeting
  6802	second, and they said, as distinctly as if she spoke, “Be brave, be
  6803	brave.”
  6804	
  6805	We left the table to go on deck, for a steamer was a welcome break in the
  6806	monotony of the sea on which we floated, while the conviction that it was
  6807	Death Larsen and the _Macedonia_ added to the excitement.  The stiff
  6808	breeze and heavy sea which had sprung up the previous afternoon had been
  6809	moderating all morning, so that it was now possible to lower the boats
  6810	for an afternoon’s hunt.  The hunting promised to be profitable.  We had
  6811	sailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals, and were now running
  6812	into the herd.
  6813	
  6814	The smoke was still miles astern, but overhauling us rapidly, when we
  6815	lowered our boats.  They spread out and struck a northerly course across
  6816	the ocean.  Now and again we saw a sail lower, heard the reports of the
  6817	shot-guns, and saw the sail go up again.  The seals were thick, the wind
  6818	was dying away; everything favoured a big catch.  As we ran off to get
  6819	our leeward position of the last lee boat, we found the ocean fairly
  6820	carpeted with sleeping seals.  They were all about us, thicker than I had
  6821	ever seen them before, in twos and threes and bunches, stretched full
  6822	length on the surface and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy
  6823	young dogs.
  6824	
  6825	Under the approaching smoke the hull and upper-works of a steamer were
  6826	growing larger.  It was the _Macedonia_.  I read her name through the
  6827	glasses as she passed by scarcely a mile to starboard.  Wolf Larsen
  6828	looked savagely at the vessel, while Maud Brewster was curious.
  6829	
  6830	“Where is the trouble you were so sure was breezing up, Captain Larsen?”
  6831	she asked gaily.
  6832	
  6833	He glanced at her, a moment’s amusement softening his features.
  6834	
  6835	“What did you expect?  That they’d come aboard and cut our throats?”
  6836	
  6837	“Something like that,” she confessed.  “You understand, seal-hunters are
  6838	so new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything.”
  6839	
  6840	He nodded his head.  “Quite right, quite right.  Your error is that you
  6841	failed to expect the worst.”
  6842	
  6843	“Why, what can be worse than cutting our throats?” she asked, with pretty
  6844	naïve surprise.
  6845	
  6846	“Cutting our purses,” he answered.  “Man is so made these days that his
  6847	capacity for living is determined by the money he possesses.”
  6848	
  6849	“’Who steals my purse steals trash,’” she quoted.
  6850	
  6851	“Who steals my purse steals my right to live,” was the reply, “old saws
  6852	to the contrary.  For he steals my bread and meat and bed, and in so
  6853	doing imperils my life.  There are not enough soup-kitchens and
  6854	bread-lines to go around, you know, and when men have nothing in their
  6855	purses they usually die, and die miserably—unless they are able to fill
  6856	their purses pretty speedily.”
  6857	
  6858	“But I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your purse.”
  6859	
  6860	“Wait and you will see,” he answered grimly.
  6861	
  6862	We did not have long to wait.  Having passed several miles beyond our
  6863	line of boats, the _Macedonia_ proceeded to lower her own.  We knew she
  6864	carried fourteen boats to our five (we were one short through the
  6865	desertion of Wainwright), and she began dropping them far to leeward of
  6866	our last boat, continued dropping them athwart our course, and finished
  6867	dropping them far to windward of our first weather boat.  The hunting,
  6868	for us, was spoiled.  There were no seals behind us, and ahead of us the
  6869	line of fourteen boats, like a huge broom, swept the herd before it.
  6870	
  6871	Our boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between them and
  6872	the point where the _Macedonia’s_ had been dropped, and then headed for
  6873	home.  The wind had fallen to a whisper, the ocean was growing calmer and
  6874	calmer, and this, coupled with the presence of the great herd, made a
  6875	perfect hunting day—one of the two or three days to be encountered in the
  6876	whole of a lucky season.  An angry lot of men, boat-pullers and steerers
  6877	as well as hunters, swarmed over our side.  Each man felt that he had
  6878	been robbed; and the boats were hoisted in amid curses, which, if curses
  6879	had power, would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity—“Dead and
  6880	damned for a dozen iv eternities,” commented Louis, his eyes twinkling up
  6881	at me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings of his boat.
  6882	
  6883	“Listen to them, and find if it is hard to discover the most vital thing
  6884	in their souls,” said Wolf Larsen.  “Faith? and love? and high ideals?
  6885	The good? the beautiful? the true?”
  6886	
  6887	“Their innate sense of right has been violated,” Maud Brewster said,
  6888	joining the conversation.
  6889	
  6890	She was standing a dozen feet away, one hand resting on the main-shrouds
  6891	and her body swaying gently to the slight roll of the ship.  She had not
  6892	raised her voice, and yet I was struck by its clear and bell-like tone.
  6893	Ah, it was sweet in my ears!  I scarcely dared look at her just then, for
  6894	the fear of betraying myself.  A boy’s cap was perched on her head, and
  6895	her hair, light brown and arranged in a loose and fluffy order that
  6896	caught the sun, seemed an aureole about the delicate oval of her face.
  6897	She was positively bewitching, and, withal, sweetly spirituelle, if not
  6898	saintly.  All my old-time marvel at life returned to me at sight of this
  6899	splendid incarnation of it, and Wolf Larsen’s cold explanation of life
  6900	and its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable.
  6901	
  6902	“A sentimentalist,” he sneered, “like Mr. Van Weyden.  Those men are
  6903	cursing because their desires have been outraged.  That is all.  What
  6904	desires?  The desires for the good grub and soft beds ashore which a
  6905	handsome pay-day brings them—the women and the drink, the gorging and the
  6906	beastliness which so truly expresses them, the best that is in them,
  6907	their highest aspirations, their ideals, if you please.  The exhibition
  6908	they make of their feelings is not a touching sight, yet it shows how
  6909	deeply they have been touched, how deeply their purses have been touched,
  6910	for to lay hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls.”
  6911	
  6912	“’You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched,” she said,
  6913	smilingly.
  6914	
  6915	“Then it so happens that I am behaving differently, for my purse and my
  6916	soul have both been touched.  At the current price of skins in the London
  6917	market, and based on a fair estimate of what the afternoon’s catch would
  6918	have been had not the _Macedonia_ hogged it, the _Ghost_ has lost about
  6919	fifteen hundred dollars’ worth of skins.”
  6920	
  6921	“You speak so calmly—” she began.
  6922	
  6923	“But I do not feel calm; I could kill the man who robbed me,” he
  6924	interrupted.  “Yes, yes, I know, and that man my brother—more sentiment!
  6925	Bah!”
  6926	
  6927	His face underwent a sudden change.  His voice was less harsh and wholly
  6928	sincere as he said:
  6929	
  6930	“You must be happy, you sentimentalists, really and truly happy at
  6931	dreaming and finding things good, and, because you find some of them
  6932	good, feeling good yourself.  Now, tell me, you two, do you find me
  6933	good?”
  6934	
  6935	“You are good to look upon—in a way,” I qualified.
  6936	
  6937	“There are in you all powers for good,” was Maud Brewster’s answer.
  6938	
  6939	“There you are!” he cried at her, half angrily.  “Your words are empty to
  6940	me.  There is nothing clear and sharp and definite about the thought you
  6941	have expressed.  You cannot pick it up in your two hands and look at it.
  6942	In point of fact, it is not a thought.  It is a feeling, a sentiment, a
  6943	something based upon illusion and not a product of the intellect at all.”
  6944	
  6945	As he went on his voice again grew soft, and a confiding note came into
  6946	it.  “Do you know, I sometimes catch myself wishing that I, too, were
  6947	blind to the facts of life and only knew its fancies and illusions.
  6948	They’re wrong, all wrong, of course, and contrary to reason; but in the
  6949	face of them my reason tells me, wrong and most wrong, that to dream and
  6950	live illusions gives greater delight.  And after all, delight is the wage
  6951	for living.  Without delight, living is a worthless act.  To labour at
  6952	living and be unpaid is worse than to be dead.  He who delights the most
  6953	lives the most, and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to
  6954	you and more gratifying than are my facts to me.”
  6955	
  6956	He shook his head slowly, pondering.
  6957	
  6958	“I often doubt, I often doubt, the worthwhileness of reason.  Dreams must
  6959	be more substantial and satisfying.  Emotional delight is more filling
  6960	and lasting than intellectual delight; and, besides, you pay for your
  6961	moments of intellectual delight by having the blues.  Emotional delight
  6962	is followed by no more than jaded senses which speedily recuperate.  I
  6963	envy you, I envy you.”
  6964	
  6965	He stopped abruptly, and then on his lips formed one of his strange
  6966	quizzical smiles, as he added:
  6967	
  6968	“It’s from my brain I envy you, take notice, and not from my heart.  My
  6969	reason dictates it.  The envy is an intellectual product.  I am like a
  6970	sober man looking upon drunken men, and, greatly weary, wishing he, too,
  6971	were drunk.”
  6972	
  6973	“Or like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he, too, were a fool,”
  6974	I laughed.
  6975	
  6976	“Quite so,” he said.  “You are a blessed, bankrupt pair of fools.  You
  6977	have no facts in your pocketbook.”
  6978	
  6979	“Yet we spend as freely as you,” was Maud Brewster’s contribution.
  6980	
  6981	“More freely, because it costs you nothing.”
  6982	
  6983	“And because we draw upon eternity,” she retorted.
  6984	
  6985	“Whether you do or think you do, it’s the same thing.  You spend what you
  6986	haven’t got, and in return you get greater value from spending what you
  6987	haven’t got than I get from spending what I have got, and what I have
  6988	sweated to get.”
  6989	
  6990	“Why don’t you change the basis of your coinage, then?” she queried
  6991	teasingly.
  6992	
  6993	He looked at her quickly, half-hopefully, and then said, all regretfully:
  6994	“Too late.  I’d like to, perhaps, but I can’t.  My pocketbook is stuffed
  6995	with the old coinage, and it’s a stubborn thing.  I can never bring
  6996	myself to recognize anything else as valid.”
  6997	
  6998	He ceased speaking, and his gaze wandered absently past her and became
  6999	lost in the placid sea.  The old primal melancholy was strong upon him.
  7000	He was quivering to it.  He had reasoned himself into a spell of the
  7001	blues, and within few hours one could look for the devil within him to be
  7002	up and stirring.  I remembered Charley Furuseth, and knew this man’s
  7003	sadness as the penalty which the materialist ever pays for his
  7004	materialism.
  7005	
  7006	
  7007	
  7008	
  7009	CHAPTER XXV
  7010	
  7011	
  7012	“You’ve been on deck, Mr. Van Weyden,” Wolf Larsen said, the following
  7013	morning at the breakfast-table, “How do things look?”
  7014	
  7015	“Clear enough,” I answered, glancing at the sunshine which streamed down
  7016	the open companion-way.  “Fair westerly breeze, with a promise of
  7017	stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.”
  7018	
  7019	He nodded his head in a pleased way.  “Any signs of fog?”
  7020	
  7021	“Thick banks in the north and north-west.”
  7022	
  7023	He nodded his head again, evincing even greater satisfaction than before.
  7024	
  7025	“What of the _Macedonia_?”
  7026	
  7027	“Not sighted,” I answered.
  7028	
  7029	I could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence, but why he should
  7030	be disappointed I could not conceive.
  7031	
  7032	I was soon to learn.  “Smoke ho!” came the hail from on deck, and his
  7033	face brightened.
  7034	
  7035	“Good!” he exclaimed, and left the table at once to go on deck and into
  7036	the steerage, where the hunters were taking the first breakfast of their
  7037	exile.
  7038	
  7039	Maud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us, gazing, instead,
  7040	in silent anxiety at each other, and listening to Wolf Larsen’s voice,
  7041	which easily penetrated the cabin through the intervening bulkhead.  He
  7042	spoke at length, and his conclusion was greeted with a wild roar of
  7043	cheers.  The bulkhead was too thick for us to hear what he said; but
  7044	whatever it was it affected the hunters strongly, for the cheering was
  7045	followed by loud exclamations and shouts of joy.
  7046	
  7047	From the sounds on deck I knew that the sailors had been routed out and
  7048	were preparing to lower the boats.  Maud Brewster accompanied me on deck,
  7049	but I left her at the break of the poop, where she might watch the scene
  7050	and not be in it.  The sailors must have learned whatever project was on
  7051	hand, and the vim and snap they put into their work attested their
  7052	enthusiasm.  The hunters came trooping on deck with shot-guns and
  7053	ammunition-boxes, and, most unusual, their rifles.  The latter were
  7054	rarely taken in the boats, for a seal shot at long range with a rifle
  7055	invariably sank before a boat could reach it.  But each hunter this day
  7056	had his rifle and a large supply of cartridges.  I noticed they grinned
  7057	with satisfaction whenever they looked at the _Macedonia’s_ smoke, which
  7058	was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west.
  7059	
  7060	The five boats went over the side with a rush, spread out like the ribs
  7061	of a fan, and set a northerly course, as on the preceding afternoon, for
  7062	us to follow.  I watched for some time, curiously, but there seemed
  7063	nothing extraordinary about their behaviour.  They lowered sails, shot
  7064	seals, and hoisted sails again, and continued on their way as I had
  7065	always seen them do.  The _Macedonia_ repeated her performance of
  7066	yesterday, “hogging” the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of
  7067	ours and across our course.  Fourteen boats require a considerable spread
  7068	of ocean for comfortable hunting, and when she had completely lapped our
  7069	line she continued steaming into the north-east, dropping more boats as
  7070	she went.
  7071	
  7072	“What’s up?” I asked Wolf Larsen, unable longer to keep my curiosity in
  7073	check.
  7074	
  7075	“Never mind what’s up,” he answered gruffly.  “You won’t be a thousand
  7076	years in finding out, and in the meantime just pray for plenty of wind.”
  7077	
  7078	“Oh, well, I don’t mind telling you,” he said the next moment.  “I’m
  7079	going to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine.  In
  7080	short, I’m going to play the hog myself, and not for one day, but for the
  7081	rest of the season,—if we’re in luck.”
  7082	
  7083	“And if we’re not?” I queried.
  7084	
  7085	“Not to be considered,” he laughed.  “We simply must be in luck, or it’s
  7086	all up with us.”
  7087	
  7088	He had the wheel at the time, and I went forward to my hospital in the
  7089	forecastle, where lay the two crippled men, Nilson and Thomas Mugridge.
  7090	Nilson was as cheerful as could be expected, for his broken leg was
  7091	knitting nicely; but the Cockney was desperately melancholy, and I was
  7092	aware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate creature.  And the marvel
  7093	of it was that still he lived and clung to life.  The brutal years had
  7094	reduced his meagre body to splintered wreckage, and yet the spark of life
  7095	within burned brightly as ever.
  7096	
  7097	“With an artificial foot—and they make excellent ones—you will be
  7098	stumping ships’ galleys to the end of time,” I assured him jovially.
  7099	
  7100	But his answer was serious, nay, solemn.  “I don’t know about wot you
  7101	s’y, Mr. Van W’yden, but I do know I’ll never rest ’appy till I see that
  7102	’ell-’ound bloody well dead.  ’E cawn’t live as long as me.  ’E’s got no
  7103	right to live, an’ as the Good Word puts it, ‘’E shall shorely die,’ an’
  7104	I s’y, ‘Amen, an’ damn soon at that.’”
  7105	
  7106	When I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly with one
  7107	hand, while with the other hand he held the marine glasses and studied
  7108	the situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position
  7109	of the _Macedonia_.  The only change noticeable in our boats was that
  7110	they had hauled close on the wind and were heading several points west of
  7111	north.  Still, I could not see the expediency of the manœuvre, for the
  7112	free sea was still intercepted by the _Macedonia’s_ five weather boats,
  7113	which, in turn, had hauled close on the wind.  Thus they slowly diverged
  7114	toward the west, drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in
  7115	their line.  Our boats were rowing as well as sailing.  Even the hunters
  7116	were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly
  7117	overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy.
  7118	
  7119	The smoke of the _Macedonia_ had dwindled to a dim blot on the
  7120	north-eastern horizon.  Of the steamer herself nothing was to be seen.
  7121	We had been loafing along, till now, our sails shaking half the time and
  7122	spilling the wind; and twice, for short periods, we had been hove to.
  7123	But there was no more loafing.  Sheets were trimmed, and Wolf Larsen
  7124	proceeded to put the _Ghost_ through her paces.  We ran past our line of
  7125	boats and bore down upon the first weather boat of the other line.
  7126	
  7127	“Down that flying jib, Mr. Van Weyden,” Wolf Larsen commanded.  “And
  7128	stand by to back over the jibs.”
  7129	
  7130	I ran forward and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in and fast as
  7131	we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward.  The three men in it
  7132	gazed at us suspiciously.  They had been hogging the sea, and they knew
  7133	Wolf Larsen, by reputation at any rate.  I noted that the hunter, a huge
  7134	Scandinavian sitting in the bow, held his rifle, ready to hand, across
  7135	his knees.  It should have been in its proper place in the rack.  When
  7136	they came opposite our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the
  7137	hand, and cried:
  7138	
  7139	“Come on board and have a ’gam’!”
  7140	
  7141	“To gam,” among the sealing-schooners, is a substitute for the verbs “to
  7142	visit,” “to gossip.”  It expresses the garrulity of the sea, and is a
  7143	pleasant break in the monotony of the life.
  7144	
  7145	The _Ghost_ swung around into the wind, and I finished my work forward in
  7146	time to run aft and lend a hand with the mainsheet.
  7147	
  7148	“You will please stay on deck, Miss Brewster,” Wolf Larsen said, as he
  7149	started forward to meet his guest.  “And you too, Mr. Van Weyden.”
  7150	
  7151	The boat had lowered its sail and run alongside.  The hunter, golden
  7152	bearded like a sea-king, came over the rail and dropped on deck.  But his
  7153	hugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness.  Doubt and
  7154	distrust showed strongly in his face.  It was a transparent face, for all
  7155	of its hairy shield, and advertised instant relief when he glanced from
  7156	Wolf Larsen to me, noted that there was only the pair of us, and then
  7157	glanced over his own two men who had joined him.  Surely he had little
  7158	reason to be afraid.  He towered like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen.  He
  7159	must have measured six feet eight or nine inches in stature, and I
  7160	subsequently learned his weight—240 pounds.  And there was no fat about
  7161	him.  It was all bone and muscle.
  7162	
  7163	A return of apprehension was apparent when, at the top of the
  7164	companion-way, Wolf Larsen invited him below.  But he reassured himself
  7165	with a glance down at his host—a big man himself but dwarfed by the
  7166	propinquity of the giant.  So all hesitancy vanished, and the pair
  7167	descended into the cabin.  In the meantime, his two men, as was the wont
  7168	of visiting sailors, had gone forward into the forecastle to do some
  7169	visiting themselves.
  7170	
  7171	Suddenly, from the cabin came a great, choking bellow, followed by all
  7172	the sounds of a furious struggle.  It was the leopard and the lion, and
  7173	the lion made all the noise.  Wolf Larsen was the leopard.
  7174	
  7175	“You see the sacredness of our hospitality,” I said bitterly to Maud
  7176	Brewster.
  7177	
  7178	She nodded her head that she heard, and I noted in her face the signs of
  7179	the same sickness at sight or sound of violent struggle from which I had
  7180	suffered so severely during my first weeks on the _Ghost_.
  7181	
  7182	“Wouldn’t it be better if you went forward, say by the steerage
  7183	companion-way, until it is over?” I suggested.
  7184	
  7185	She shook her head and gazed at me pitifully.  She was not frightened,
  7186	but appalled, rather, at the human animality of it.
  7187	
  7188	“You will understand,” I took advantage of the opportunity to say,
  7189	“whatever part I take in what is going on and what is to come, that I am
  7190	compelled to take it—if you and I are ever to get out of this scrape with
  7191	our lives.”
  7192	
  7193	“It is not nice—for me,” I added.
  7194	
  7195	“I understand,” she said, in a weak, far-away voice, and her eyes showed
  7196	me that she did understand.
  7197	
  7198	The sounds from below soon died away.  Then Wolf Larsen came alone on
  7199	deck.  There was a slight flush under his bronze, but otherwise he bore
  7200	no signs of the battle.
  7201	
  7202	“Send those two men aft, Mr. Van Weyden,” he said.
  7203	
  7204	I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.  “Hoist in
  7205	your boat,” he said to them.  “Your hunter’s decided to stay aboard
  7206	awhile and doesn’t want it pounding alongside.”
  7207	
  7208	“Hoist in your boat, I said,” he repeated, this time in sharper tones as
  7209	they hesitated to do his bidding.
  7210	
  7211	“Who knows? you may have to sail with me for a time,” he said, quite
  7212	softly, with a silken threat that belied the softness, as they moved
  7213	slowly to comply, “and we might as well start with a friendly
  7214	understanding.  Lively now!  Death Larsen makes you jump better than
  7215	that, and you know it!”
  7216	
  7217	Their movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching, and as the boat
  7218	swung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs.  Wolf Larsen, at the
  7219	wheel, directed the _Ghost_ after the _Macedonia’s_ second weather boat.
  7220	
  7221	Under way, and with nothing for the time being to do, I turned my
  7222	attention to the situation of the boats.  The _Macedonia’s_ third weather
  7223	boat was being attacked by two of ours, the fourth by our remaining
  7224	three; and the fifth, turn about, was taking a hand in the defence of its
  7225	nearest mate.  The fight had opened at long distance, and the rifles were
  7226	cracking steadily.  A quick, snappy sea was being kicked up by the wind,
  7227	a condition which prevented fine shooting; and now and again, as we drew
  7228	closer, we could see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave.
  7229	
  7230	The boat we were pursuing had squared away and was running before the
  7231	wind to escape us, and, in the course of its flight, to take part in
  7232	repulsing our general boat attack.
  7233	
  7234	Attending to sheets and tacks now left me little time to see what was
  7235	taking place, but I happened to be on the poop when Wolf Larsen ordered
  7236	the two strange sailors forward and into the forecastle.  They went
  7237	sullenly, but they went.  He next ordered Miss Brewster below, and smiled
  7238	at the instant horror that leapt into her eyes.
  7239	
  7240	“You’ll find nothing gruesome down there,” he said, “only an unhurt man
  7241	securely made fast to the ring-bolts.  Bullets are liable to come aboard,
  7242	and I don’t want you killed, you know.”
  7243	
  7244	Even as he spoke, a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped spoke of the
  7245	wheel between his hands and screeched off through the air to windward.
  7246	
  7247	“You see,” he said to her; and then to me, “Mr. Van Weyden, will you take
  7248	the wheel?”
  7249	
  7250	Maud Brewster had stepped inside the companion-way so that only her head
  7251	was exposed.  Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and was throwing a
  7252	cartridge into the barrel.  I begged her with my eyes to go below, but
  7253	she smiled and said:
  7254	
  7255	“We may be feeble land-creatures without legs, but we can show Captain
  7256	Larsen that we are at least as brave as he.”
  7257	
  7258	He gave her a quick look of admiration.
  7259	
  7260	“I like you a hundred per cent. better for that,” he said.  “Books, and
  7261	brains, and bravery.  You are well-rounded, a blue-stocking fit to be the
  7262	wife of a pirate chief.  Ahem, we’ll discuss that later,” he smiled, as a
  7263	bullet struck solidly into the cabin wall.
  7264	
  7265	I saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke, and I saw the terror mount in
  7266	her own.
  7267	
  7268	“We are braver,” I hastened to say.  “At least, speaking for myself, I
  7269	know I am braver than Captain Larsen.”
  7270	
  7271	It was I who was now favoured by a quick look.  He was wondering if I
  7272	were making fun of him.  I put three or four spokes over to counteract a
  7273	sheer toward the wind on the part of the _Ghost_, and then steadied her.
  7274	Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation, and I pointed down to my
  7275	knees.
  7276	
  7277	“You will observe there,” I said, “a slight trembling.  It is because I
  7278	am afraid, the flesh is afraid; and I am afraid in my mind because I do
  7279	not wish to die.  But my spirit masters the trembling flesh and the
  7280	qualms of the mind.  I am more than brave.  I am courageous.  Your flesh
  7281	is not afraid.  You are not afraid.  On the one hand, it costs you
  7282	nothing to encounter danger; on the other hand, it even gives you
  7283	delight.  You enjoy it.  You may be unafraid, Mr. Larsen, but you must
  7284	grant that the bravery is mine.”
  7285	
  7286	“You’re right,” he acknowledged at once.  “I never thought of it in that
  7287	way before.  But is the opposite true?  If you are braver than I, am I
  7288	more cowardly than you?”
  7289	
  7290	We both laughed at the absurdity, and he dropped down to the deck and
  7291	rested his rifle across the rail.  The bullets we had received had
  7292	travelled nearly a mile, but by now we had cut that distance in half.  He
  7293	fired three careful shots.  The first struck fifty feet to windward of
  7294	the boat, the second alongside; and at the third the boat-steerer let
  7295	loose his steering-oar and crumpled up in the bottom of the boat.
  7296	
  7297	“I guess that’ll fix them,” Wolf Larsen said, rising to his feet.  “I
  7298	couldn’t afford to let the hunter have it, and there is a chance the
  7299	boat-puller doesn’t know how to steer.  In which case, the hunter cannot
  7300	steer and shoot at the same time.”
  7301	
  7302	His reasoning was justified, for the boat rushed at once into the wind
  7303	and the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer’s place.  There was no
  7304	more shooting, though the rifles were still cracking merrily from the
  7305	other boats.
  7306	
  7307	The hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again, but we ran
  7308	down upon it, going at least two feet to its one.  A hundred yards away,
  7309	I saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter.  Wolf Larsen went
  7310	amidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards from its pin.  Then he
  7311	peered over the rail with levelled rifle.  Twice I saw the hunter let go
  7312	the steering-oar with one hand, reach for his rifle, and hesitate.  We
  7313	were now alongside and foaming past.
  7314	
  7315	“Here, you!” Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller.  “Take a
  7316	turn!”
  7317	
  7318	At the same time he flung the coil of rope.  It struck fairly, nearly
  7319	knocking the man over, but he did not obey.  Instead, he looked to his
  7320	hunter for orders.  The hunter, in turn, was in a quandary.  His rifle
  7321	was between his knees, but if he let go the steering-oar in order to
  7322	shoot, the boat would sweep around and collide with the schooner.  Also
  7323	he saw Wolf Larsen’s rifle bearing upon him and knew he would be shot ere
  7324	he could get his rifle into play.
  7325	
  7326	“Take a turn,” he said quietly to the man.
  7327	
  7328	The boat-puller obeyed, taking a turn around the little forward thwart
  7329	and paying the line as it jerked taut.  The boat sheered out with a rush,
  7330	and the hunter steadied it to a parallel course some twenty feet from the
  7331	side of the _Ghost_.
  7332	
  7333	“Now, get that sail down and come alongside!” Wolf Larsen ordered.
  7334	
  7335	He never let go his rifle, even passing down the tackles with one hand.
  7336	When they were fast, bow and stern, and the two uninjured men prepared to
  7337	come aboard, the hunter picked up his rifle as if to place it in a secure
  7338	position.
  7339	
  7340	“Drop it!” Wolf Larsen cried, and the hunter dropped it as though it were
  7341	hot and had burned him.
  7342	
  7343	Once aboard, the two prisoners hoisted in the boat and under Wolf
  7344	Larsen’s direction carried the wounded boat-steerer down into the
  7345	forecastle.
  7346	
  7347	“If our five boats do as well as you and I have done, we’ll have a pretty
  7348	full crew,” Wolf Larsen said to me.
  7349	
  7350	“The man you shot—he is—I hope?” Maud Brewster quavered.
  7351	
  7352	“In the shoulder,” he answered.  “Nothing serious, Mr. Van Weyden will
  7353	pull him around as good as ever in three or four weeks.”
  7354	
  7355	“But he won’t pull those chaps around, from the look of it,” he added,
  7356	pointing at the _Macedonia’s_ third boat, for which I had been steering
  7357	and which was now nearly abreast of us.  “That’s Horner’s and Smoke’s
  7358	work.  I told them we wanted live men, not carcasses.  But the joy of
  7359	shooting to hit is a most compelling thing, when once you’ve learned how
  7360	to shoot.  Ever experienced it, Mr. Van Weyden?”
  7361	
  7362	I shook my head and regarded their work.  It had indeed been bloody, for
  7363	they had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the
  7364	remaining two of the enemy.  The deserted boat was in the trough of the
  7365	sea, rolling drunkenly across each comber, its loose spritsail out at
  7366	right angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind.  The hunter
  7367	and boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom, but the
  7368	boat-steerer lay across the gunwale, half in and half out, his arms
  7369	trailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side.
  7370	
  7371	“Don’t look, Miss Brewster, please don’t look,” I had begged of her, and
  7372	I was glad that she had minded me and been spared the sight.
  7373	
  7374	“Head right into the bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,” was Wolf Larsen’s command.
  7375	
  7376	As we drew nearer, the firing ceased, and we saw that the fight was over.
  7377	The remaining two boats had been captured by our five, and the seven were
  7378	grouped together, waiting to be picked up.
  7379	
  7380	“Look at that!” I cried involuntarily, pointing to the north-east.
  7381	
  7382	The blot of smoke which indicated the _Macedonia’s_ position had
  7383	reappeared.
  7384	
  7385	“Yes, I’ve been watching it,” was Wolf Larsen’s calm reply.  He measured
  7386	the distance away to the fog-bank, and for an instant paused to feel the
  7387	weight of the wind on his cheek.  “We’ll make it, I think; but you can
  7388	depend upon it that blessed brother of mine has twigged our little game
  7389	and is just a-humping for us.  Ah, look at that!”
  7390	
  7391	The blot of smoke had suddenly grown larger, and it was very black.
  7392	
  7393	“I’ll beat you out, though, brother mine,” he chuckled.  “I’ll beat you
  7394	out, and I hope you no worse than that you rack your old engines into
  7395	scrap.”
  7396	
  7397	When we hove to, a hasty though orderly confusion reigned.  The boats
  7398	came aboard from every side at once.  As fast as the prisoners came over
  7399	the rail they were marshalled forward to the forecastle by our hunters,
  7400	while our sailors hoisted in the boats, pell-mell, dropping them anywhere
  7401	upon the deck and not stopping to lash them.  We were already under way,
  7402	all sails set and drawing, and the sheets being slacked off for a wind
  7403	abeam, as the last boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the
  7404	tackles.
  7405	
  7406	There was need for haste.  The _Macedonia_, belching the blackest of
  7407	smoke from her funnel, was charging down upon us from out of the
  7408	north-east.  Neglecting the boats that remained to her, she had altered
  7409	her course so as to anticipate ours.  She was not running straight for
  7410	us, but ahead of us.  Our courses were converging like the sides of an
  7411	angle, the vertex of which was at the edge of the fog-bank.  It was
  7412	there, or not at all, that the _Macedonia_ could hope to catch us.  The
  7413	hope for the _Ghost_ lay in that she should pass that point before the
  7414	_Macedonia_ arrived at it.
  7415	
  7416	Wolf Larsen was steering, his eyes glistening and snapping as they dwelt
  7417	upon and leaped from detail to detail of the chase.  Now he studied the
  7418	sea to windward for signs of the wind slackening or freshening, now the
  7419	_Macedonia_; and again, his eyes roved over every sail, and he gave
  7420	commands to slack a sheet here a trifle, to come in on one there a
  7421	trifle, till he was drawing out of the _Ghost_ the last bit of speed she
  7422	possessed.  All feuds and grudges were forgotten, and I was surprised at
  7423	the alacrity with which the men who had so long endured his brutality
  7424	sprang to execute his orders.  Strange to say, the unfortunate Johnson
  7425	came into my mind as we lifted and surged and heeled along, and I was
  7426	aware of a regret that he was not alive and present; he had so loved the
  7427	_Ghost_ and delighted in her sailing powers.
  7428	
  7429	“Better get your rifles, you fellows,” Wolf Larsen called to our hunters;
  7430	and the five men lined the lee rail, guns in hand, and waited.
  7431	
  7432	The _Macedonia_ was now but a mile away, the black smoke pouring from her
  7433	funnel at a right angle, so madly she raced, pounding through the sea at
  7434	a seventeen-knot gait—“’Sky-hooting through the brine,” as Wolf Larsen
  7435	quoted while gazing at her.  We were not making more than nine knots, but
  7436	the fog-bank was very near.
  7437	
  7438	A puff of smoke broke from the _Macedonia’s_ deck, we heard a heavy
  7439	report, and a round hole took form in the stretched canvas of our
  7440	mainsail.  They were shooting at us with one of the small cannon which
  7441	rumour had said they carried on board.  Our men, clustering amidships,
  7442	waved their hats and raised a derisive cheer.  Again there was a puff of
  7443	smoke and a loud report, this time the cannon-ball striking not more than
  7444	twenty feet astern and glancing twice from sea to sea to windward ere it
  7445	sank.
  7446	
  7447	But there was no rifle-firing for the reason that all their hunters were
  7448	out in the boats or our prisoners.  When the two vessels were half-a-mile
  7449	apart, a third shot made another hole in our mainsail.  Then we entered
  7450	the fog.  It was about us, veiling and hiding us in its dense wet gauze.
  7451	
  7452	The sudden transition was startling.  The moment before we had been
  7453	leaping through the sunshine, the clear sky above us, the sea breaking
  7454	and rolling wide to the horizon, and a ship, vomiting smoke and fire and
  7455	iron missiles, rushing madly upon us.  And at once, as in an instant’s
  7456	leap, the sun was blotted out, there was no sky, even our mastheads were
  7457	lost to view, and our horizon was such as tear-blinded eyes may see.  The
  7458	grey mist drove by us like a rain.  Every woollen filament of our
  7459	garments, every hair of our heads and faces, was jewelled with a crystal
  7460	globule.  The shrouds were wet with moisture; it dripped from our rigging
  7461	overhead; and on the underside of our booms drops of water took shape in
  7462	long swaying lines, which were detached and flung to the deck in mimic
  7463	showers at each surge of the schooner.  I was aware of a pent, stifled
  7464	feeling.  As the sounds of the ship thrusting herself through the waves
  7465	were hurled back upon us by the fog, so were one’s thoughts.  The mind
  7466	recoiled from contemplation of a world beyond this wet veil which wrapped
  7467	us around.  This was the world, the universe itself, its bounds so near
  7468	one felt impelled to reach out both arms and push them back.  It was
  7469	impossible, that the rest could be beyond these walls of grey.  The rest
  7470	was a dream, no more than the memory of a dream.
  7471	
  7472	It was weird, strangely weird.  I looked at Maud Brewster and knew that
  7473	she was similarly affected.  Then I looked at Wolf Larsen, but there was
  7474	nothing subjective about his state of consciousness.  His whole concern
  7475	was with the immediate, objective present.  He still held the wheel, and
  7476	I felt that he was timing Time, reckoning the passage of the minutes with
  7477	each forward lunge and leeward roll of the _Ghost_.
  7478	
  7479	“Go for’ard and hard alee without any noise,” he said to me in a low
  7480	voice.  “Clew up the topsails first.  Set men at all the sheets.  Let
  7481	there be no rattling of blocks, no sound of voices.  No noise,
  7482	understand, no noise.”
  7483	
  7484	When all was ready, the word “hard-a-lee” was passed forward to me from
  7485	man to man; and the _Ghost_ heeled about on the port tack with
  7486	practically no noise at all.  And what little there was,—the slapping of
  7487	a few reef-points and the creaking of a sheave in a block or two,—was
  7488	ghostly under the hollow echoing pall in which we were swathed.
  7489	
  7490	We had scarcely filled away, it seemed, when the fog thinned abruptly and
  7491	we were again in the sunshine, the wide-stretching sea breaking before us
  7492	to the sky-line.  But the ocean was bare.  No wrathful _Macedonia_ broke
  7493	its surface nor blackened the sky with her smoke.
  7494	
  7495	Wolf Larsen at once squared away and ran down along the rim of the
  7496	fog-bank.  His trick was obvious.  He had entered the fog to windward of
  7497	the steamer, and while the steamer had blindly driven on into the fog in
  7498	the chance of catching him, he had come about and out of his shelter and
  7499	was now running down to re-enter to leeward.  Successful in this, the old
  7500	simile of the needle in the haystack would be mild indeed compared with
  7501	his brother’s chance of finding him.  He did not run long.  Jibing the
  7502	fore- and main-sails and setting the topsails again, we headed back into
  7503	the bank.  As we entered I could have sworn I saw a vague bulk emerging
  7504	to windward.  I looked quickly at Wolf Larsen.  Already we were ourselves
  7505	buried in the fog, but he nodded his head.  He, too, had seen it—the
  7506	_Macedonia_, guessing his manœuvre and failing by a moment in
  7507	anticipating it.  There was no doubt that we had escaped unseen.
  7508	
  7509	“He can’t keep this up,” Wolf Larsen said.  “He’ll have to go back for
  7510	the rest of his boats.  Send a man to the wheel, Mr. Van Weyden, keep
  7511	this course for the present, and you might as well set the watches, for
  7512	we won’t do any lingering to-night.”
  7513	
  7514	“I’d give five hundred dollars, though,” he added, “just to be aboard the
  7515	_Macedonia_ for five minutes, listening to my brother curse.”
  7516	
  7517	“And now, Mr. Van Weyden,” he said to me when he had been relieved from
  7518	the wheel, “we must make these new-comers welcome.  Serve out plenty of
  7519	whisky to the hunters and see that a few bottles slip for’ard.  I’ll
  7520	wager every man Jack of them is over the side to-morrow, hunting for Wolf
  7521	Larsen as contentedly as ever they hunted for Death Larsen.”
  7522	
  7523	“But won’t they escape as Wainwright did?” I asked.
  7524	
  7525	He laughed shrewdly.  “Not as long as our old hunters have anything to
  7526	say about it.  I’m dividing amongst them a dollar a skin for all the
  7527	skins shot by our new hunters.  At least half of their enthusiasm to-day
  7528	was due to that.  Oh, no, there won’t be any escaping if they have
  7529	anything to say about it.  And now you’d better get for’ard to your
  7530	hospital duties.  There must be a full ward waiting for you.”
  7531	
  7532	
  7533	
  7534	
  7535	CHAPTER XXVI
  7536	
  7537	
  7538	Wolf Larsen took the distribution of the whisky off my hands, and the
  7539	bottles began to make their appearance while I worked over the fresh
  7540	batch of wounded men in the forecastle.  I had seen whisky drunk, such as
  7541	whisky-and-soda by the men of the clubs, but never as these men drank it,
  7542	from pannikins and mugs, and from the bottles—great brimming drinks, each
  7543	one of which was in itself a debauch.  But they did not stop at one or
  7544	two.  They drank and drank, and ever the bottles slipped forward and they
  7545	drank more.
  7546	
  7547	Everybody drank; the wounded drank; Oofty-Oofty, who helped me, drank.
  7548	Only Louis refrained, no more than cautiously wetting his lips with the
  7549	liquor, though he joined in the revels with an abandon equal to that of
  7550	most of them.  It was a saturnalia.  In loud voices they shouted over the
  7551	day’s fighting, wrangled about details, or waxed affectionate and made
  7552	friends with the men whom they had fought.  Prisoners and captors
  7553	hiccoughed on one another’s shoulders, and swore mighty oaths of respect
  7554	and esteem.  They wept over the miseries of the past and over the
  7555	miseries yet to come under the iron rule of Wolf Larsen.  And all cursed
  7556	him and told terrible tales of his brutality.
  7557	
  7558	It was a strange and frightful spectacle—the small, bunk-lined space, the
  7559	floor and walls leaping and lurching, the dim light, the swaying shadows
  7560	lengthening and fore-shortening monstrously, the thick air heavy with
  7561	smoke and the smell of bodies and iodoform, and the inflamed faces of the
  7562	men—half-men, I should call them.  I noted Oofty-Oofty, holding the end
  7563	of a bandage and looking upon the scene, his velvety and luminous eyes
  7564	glistening in the light like a deer’s eyes, and yet I knew the barbaric
  7565	devil that lurked in his breast and belied all the softness and
  7566	tenderness, almost womanly, of his face and form.  And I noticed the
  7567	boyish face of Harrison,—a good face once, but now a demon’s,—convulsed
  7568	with passion as he told the new-comers of the hell-ship they were in and
  7569	shrieked curses upon the head of Wolf Larsen.
  7570	
  7571	Wolf Larsen it was, always Wolf Larsen, enslaver and tormentor of men, a
  7572	male Circe and these his swine, suffering brutes that grovelled before
  7573	him and revolted only in drunkenness and in secrecy.  And was I, too, one
  7574	of his swine? I thought.  And Maud Brewster?  No!  I ground my teeth in
  7575	my anger and determination till the man I was attending winced under my
  7576	hand and Oofty-Oofty looked at me with curiosity.  I felt endowed with a
  7577	sudden strength.  What of my new-found love, I was a giant.  I feared
  7578	nothing.  I would work my will through it all, in spite of Wolf Larsen
  7579	and of my own thirty-five bookish years.  All would be well.  I would
  7580	make it well.  And so, exalted, upborne by a sense of power, I turned my
  7581	back on the howling inferno and climbed to the deck, where the fog
  7582	drifted ghostly through the night and the air was sweet and pure and
  7583	quiet.
  7584	
  7585	The steerage, where were two wounded hunters, was a repetition of the
  7586	forecastle, except that Wolf Larsen was not being cursed; and it was with
  7587	a great relief that I again emerged on deck and went aft to the cabin.
  7588	Supper was ready, and Wolf Larsen and Maud were waiting for me.
  7589	
  7590	While all his ship was getting drunk as fast as it could, he remained
  7591	sober.  Not a drop of liquor passed his lips.  He did not dare it under
  7592	the circumstances, for he had only Louis and me to depend upon, and Louis
  7593	was even now at the wheel.  We were sailing on through the fog without a
  7594	look-out and without lights.  That Wolf Larsen had turned the liquor
  7595	loose among his men surprised me, but he evidently knew their psychology
  7596	and the best method of cementing in cordiality, what had begun in
  7597	bloodshed.
  7598	
  7599	His victory over Death Larsen seemed to have had a remarkable effect upon
  7600	him.  The previous evening he had reasoned himself into the blues, and I
  7601	had been waiting momentarily for one of his characteristic outbursts.
  7602	Yet nothing had occurred, and he was now in splendid trim.  Possibly his
  7603	success in capturing so many hunters and boats had counteracted the
  7604	customary reaction.  At any rate, the blues were gone, and the blue
  7605	devils had not put in an appearance.  So I thought at the time; but, ah
  7606	me, little I knew him or knew that even then, perhaps, he was meditating
  7607	an outbreak more terrible than any I had seen.
  7608	
  7609	As I say, he discovered himself in splendid trim when I entered the
  7610	cabin.  He had had no headaches for weeks, his eyes were clear blue as
  7611	the sky, his bronze was beautiful with perfect health; life swelled
  7612	through his veins in full and magnificent flood.  While waiting for me he
  7613	had engaged Maud in animated discussion.  Temptation was the topic they
  7614	had hit upon, and from the few words I heard I made out that he was
  7615	contending that temptation was temptation only when a man was seduced by
  7616	it and fell.
  7617	
  7618	“For look you,” he was saying, “as I see it, a man does things because of
  7619	desire.  He has many desires.  He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy
  7620	pleasure.  But whatever he does, he does because he desires to do it.”
  7621	
  7622	“But suppose he desires to do two opposite things, neither of which will
  7623	permit him to do the other?” Maud interrupted.
  7624	
  7625	“The very thing I was coming to,” he said.
  7626	
  7627	“And between these two desires is just where the soul of the man is
  7628	manifest,” she went on.  “If it is a good soul, it will desire and do the
  7629	good action, and the contrary if it is a bad soul.  It is the soul that
  7630	decides.”
  7631	
  7632	“Bosh and nonsense!” he exclaimed impatiently.  “It is the desire that
  7633	decides.  Here is a man who wants to, say, get drunk.  Also, he doesn’t
  7634	want to get drunk.  What does he do?  How does he do it?  He is a puppet.
  7635	He is the creature of his desires, and of the two desires he obeys the
  7636	strongest one, that is all.  His soul hasn’t anything to do with it.  How
  7637	can he be tempted to get drunk and refuse to get drunk?  If the desire to
  7638	remain sober prevails, it is because it is the strongest desire.
  7639	Temptation plays no part, unless—” he paused while grasping the new
  7640	thought which had come into his mind—“unless he is tempted to remain
  7641	sober.
  7642	
  7643	“Ha! ha!” he laughed.  “What do you think of that, Mr. Van Weyden?”
  7644	
  7645	“That both of you are hair-splitting,” I said.  “The man’s soul is his
  7646	desires.  Or, if you will, the sum of his desires is his soul.  Therein
  7647	you are both wrong.  You lay the stress upon the desire apart from the
  7648	soul, Miss Brewster lays the stress on the soul apart from the desire,
  7649	and in point of fact soul and desire are the same thing.
  7650	
  7651	“However,” I continued, “Miss Brewster is right in contending that
  7652	temptation is temptation whether the man yield or overcome.  Fire is
  7653	fanned by the wind until it leaps up fiercely.  So is desire like fire.
  7654	It is fanned, as by a wind, by sight of the thing desired, or by a new
  7655	and luring description or comprehension of the thing desired.  There lies
  7656	the temptation.  It is the wind that fans the desire until it leaps up to
  7657	mastery.  That’s temptation.  It may not fan sufficiently to make the
  7658	desire overmastering, but in so far as it fans at all, that far is it
  7659	temptation.  And, as you say, it may tempt for good as well as for evil.”
  7660	
  7661	I felt proud of myself as we sat down to the table.  My words had been
  7662	decisive.  At least they had put an end to the discussion.
  7663	
  7664	But Wolf Larsen seemed voluble, prone to speech as I had never seen him
  7665	before.  It was as though he were bursting with pent energy which must
  7666	find an outlet somehow.  Almost immediately he launched into a discussion
  7667	on love.  As usual, his was the sheer materialistic side, and Maud’s was
  7668	the idealistic.  For myself, beyond a word or so of suggestion or
  7669	correction now and again, I took no part.
  7670	
  7671	He was brilliant, but so was Maud, and for some time I lost the thread of
  7672	the conversation through studying her face as she talked.  It was a face
  7673	that rarely displayed colour, but to-night it was flushed and vivacious.
  7674	Her wit was playing keenly, and she was enjoying the tilt as much as Wolf
  7675	Larsen, and he was enjoying it hugely.  For some reason, though I know
  7676	not why in the argument, so utterly had I lost it in the contemplation of
  7677	one stray brown lock of Maud’s hair, he quoted from Iseult at Tintagel,
  7678	where she says:
  7679	
  7680	   “Blessed am I beyond women even herein,
  7681	   That beyond all born women is my sin,
  7682	   And perfect my transgression.”
  7683	
  7684	As he had read pessimism into Omar, so now he read triumph, stinging
  7685	triumph and exultation, into Swinburne’s lines.  And he read rightly, and
  7686	he read well.  He had hardly ceased reading when Louis put his head into
  7687	the companion-way and whispered down:
  7688	
  7689	“Be easy, will ye?  The fog’s lifted, an’ ’tis the port light iv a
  7690	steamer that’s crossin’ our bow this blessed minute.”
  7691	
  7692	Wolf Larsen sprang on deck, and so swiftly that by the time we followed
  7693	him he had pulled the steerage-slide over the drunken clamour and was on
  7694	his way forward to close the forecastle-scuttle.  The fog, though it
  7695	remained, had lifted high, where it obscured the stars and made the night
  7696	quite black.  Directly ahead of us I could see a bright red light and a
  7697	white light, and I could hear the pulsing of a steamer’s engines.  Beyond
  7698	a doubt it was the _Macedonia_.
  7699	
  7700	Wolf Larsen had returned to the poop, and we stood in a silent group,
  7701	watching the lights rapidly cross our bow.
  7702	
  7703	“Lucky for me he doesn’t carry a searchlight,” Wolf Larsen said.
  7704	
  7705	“What if I should cry out loudly?” I queried in a whisper.
  7706	
  7707	“It would be all up,” he answered.  “But have you thought upon what would
  7708	immediately happen?”
  7709	
  7710	Before I had time to express any desire to know, he had me by the throat
  7711	with his gorilla grip, and by a faint quiver of the muscles—a hint, as it
  7712	were—he suggested to me the twist that would surely have broken my neck.
  7713	The next moment he had released me and we were gazing at the
  7714	_Macedonia’s_ lights.
  7715	
  7716	“What if I should cry out?” Maud asked.
  7717	
  7718	“I like you too well to hurt you,” he said softly—nay, there was a
  7719	tenderness and a caress in his voice that made me wince.
  7720	
  7721	“But don’t do it, just the same, for I’d promptly break Mr. Van Weyden’s
  7722	neck.”
  7723	
  7724	“Then she has my permission to cry out,” I said defiantly.
  7725	
  7726	“I hardly think you’ll care to sacrifice the Dean of American Letters the
  7727	Second,” he sneered.
  7728	
  7729	We spoke no more, though we had become too used to one another for the
  7730	silence to be awkward; and when the red light and the white had
  7731	disappeared we returned to the cabin to finish the interrupted supper.
  7732	
  7733	Again they fell to quoting, and Maud gave Dowson’s “Impenitentia Ultima.”
  7734	She rendered it beautifully, but I watched not her, but Wolf Larsen.  I
  7735	was fascinated by the fascinated look he bent upon Maud.  He was quite
  7736	out of himself, and I noticed the unconscious movement of his lips as he
  7737	shaped word for word as fast as she uttered them.  He interrupted her
  7738	when she gave the lines:
  7739	
  7740	   “And her eyes should be my light while the sun went out behind me,
  7741	   And the viols in her voice be the last sound in my ear.”
  7742	
  7743	“There are viols in your voice,” he said bluntly, and his eyes flashed
  7744	their golden light.
  7745	
  7746	I could have shouted with joy at her control.  She finished the
  7747	concluding stanza without faltering and then slowly guided the
  7748	conversation into less perilous channels.  And all the while I sat in a
  7749	half-daze, the drunken riot of the steerage breaking through the
  7750	bulkhead, the man I feared and the woman I loved talking on and on.  The
  7751	table was not cleared.  The man who had taken Mugridge’s place had
  7752	evidently joined his comrades in the forecastle.
  7753	
  7754	If ever Wolf Larsen attained the summit of living, he attained it then.
  7755	From time to time I forsook my own thoughts to follow him, and I followed
  7756	in amaze, mastered for the moment by his remarkable intellect, under the
  7757	spell of his passion, for he was preaching the passion of revolt.  It was
  7758	inevitable that Milton’s Lucifer should be instanced, and the keenness
  7759	with which Wolf Larsen analysed and depicted the character was a
  7760	revelation of his stifled genius.  It reminded me of Taine, yet I knew
  7761	the man had never heard of that brilliant though dangerous thinker.
  7762	
  7763	“He led a lost cause, and he was not afraid of God’s thunderbolts,” Wolf
  7764	Larsen was saying.  “Hurled into hell, he was unbeaten.  A third of God’s
  7765	angels he had led with him, and straightway he incited man to rebel
  7766	against God, and gained for himself and hell the major portion of all the
  7767	generations of man.  Why was he beaten out of heaven?  Because he was
  7768	less brave than God? less proud? less aspiring?  No!  A thousand times
  7769	no!  God was more powerful, as he said, Whom thunder hath made greater.
  7770	But Lucifer was a free spirit.  To serve was to suffocate.  He preferred
  7771	suffering in freedom to all the happiness of a comfortable servility.  He
  7772	did not care to serve God.  He cared to serve nothing.  He was no
  7773	figure-head.  He stood on his own legs.  He was an individual.”
  7774	
  7775	“The first Anarchist,” Maud laughed, rising and preparing to withdraw to
  7776	her state-room.
  7777	
  7778	“Then it is good to be an anarchist!” he cried.  He, too, had risen, and
  7779	he stood facing her, where she had paused at the door of her room, as he
  7780	went on:
  7781	
  7782	               “‘Here at least
  7783	   We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built
  7784	   Here for his envy; will not drive us hence;
  7785	   Here we may reign secure; and in my choice
  7786	   To reign is worth ambition, though in hell:
  7787	   Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.”
  7788	
  7789	It was the defiant cry of a mighty spirit.  The cabin still rang with his
  7790	voice, as he stood there, swaying, his bronzed face shining, his head up
  7791	and dominant, and his eyes, golden and masculine, intensely masculine and
  7792	insistently soft, flashing upon Maud at the door.
  7793	
  7794	Again that unnamable and unmistakable terror was in her eyes, and she
  7795	said, almost in a whisper, “You are Lucifer.”
  7796	
  7797	The door closed and she was gone.  He stood staring after her for a
  7798	minute, then returned to himself and to me.
  7799	
  7800	“I’ll relieve Louis at the wheel,” he said shortly, “and call upon you to
  7801	relieve at midnight.  Better turn in now and get some sleep.”
  7802	
  7803	He pulled on a pair of mittens, put on his cap, and ascended the
  7804	companion-stairs, while I followed his suggestion by going to bed.  For
  7805	some unknown reason, prompted mysteriously, I did not undress, but lay
  7806	down fully clothed.  For a time I listened to the clamour in the steerage
  7807	and marvelled upon the love which had come to me; but my sleep on the
  7808	_Ghost_ had become most healthful and natural, and soon the songs and
  7809	cries died away, my eyes closed, and my consciousness sank down into the
  7810	half-death of slumber.
  7811	
  7812	                                * * * * *
  7813	
  7814	I knew not what had aroused me, but I found myself out of my bunk, on my
  7815	feet, wide awake, my soul vibrating to the warning of danger as it might
  7816	have thrilled to a trumpet call.  I threw open the door.  The cabin light
  7817	was burning low.  I saw Maud, my Maud, straining and struggling and
  7818	crushed in the embrace of Wolf Larsen’s arms.  I could see the vain beat
  7819	and flutter of her as she strove, pressing her face against his breast,
  7820	to escape from him.  All this I saw on the very instant of seeing and as
  7821	I sprang forward.
  7822	
  7823	I struck him with my fist, on the face, as he raised his head, but it was
  7824	a puny blow.  He roared in a ferocious, animal-like way, and gave me a
  7825	shove with his hand.  It was only a shove, a flirt of the wrist, yet so
  7826	tremendous was his strength that I was hurled backward as from a
  7827	catapult.  I struck the door of the state-room which had formerly been
  7828	Mugridge’s, splintering and smashing the panels with the impact of my
  7829	body.  I struggled to my feet, with difficulty dragging myself clear of
  7830	the wrecked door, unaware of any hurt whatever.  I was conscious only of
  7831	an overmastering rage.  I think I, too, cried aloud, as I drew the knife
  7832	at my hip and sprang forward a second time.
  7833	
  7834	But something had happened.  They were reeling apart.  I was close upon
  7835	him, my knife uplifted, but I withheld the blow.  I was puzzled by the
  7836	strangeness of it.  Maud was leaning against the wall, one hand out for
  7837	support; but he was staggering, his left hand pressed against his
  7838	forehead and covering his eyes, and with the right he was groping about
  7839	him in a dazed sort of way.  It struck against the wall, and his body
  7840	seemed to express a muscular and physical relief at the contact, as
  7841	though he had found his bearings, his location in space as well as
  7842	something against which to lean.
  7843	
  7844	Then I saw red again.  All my wrongs and humiliations flashed upon me
  7845	with a dazzling brightness, all that I had suffered and others had
  7846	suffered at his hands, all the enormity of the man’s very existence.  I
  7847	sprang upon him, blindly, insanely, and drove the knife into his
  7848	shoulder.  I knew, then, that it was no more than a flesh wound,—I had
  7849	felt the steel grate on his shoulder-blade,—and I raised the knife to
  7850	strike at a more vital part.
  7851	
  7852	But Maud had seen my first blow, and she cried, “Don’t!  Please don’t!”
  7853	
  7854	I dropped my arm for a moment, and a moment only.  Again the knife was
  7855	raised, and Wolf Larsen would have surely died had she not stepped
  7856	between.  Her arms were around me, her hair was brushing my face.  My
  7857	pulse rushed up in an unwonted manner, yet my rage mounted with it.  She
  7858	looked me bravely in the eyes.
  7859	
  7860	“For my sake,” she begged.
  7861	
  7862	“I would kill him for your sake!” I cried, trying to free my arm without
  7863	hurting her.
  7864	
  7865	“Hush!” she said, and laid her fingers lightly on my lips.  I could have
  7866	kissed them, had I dared, even then, in my rage, the touch of them was so
  7867	sweet, so very sweet.  “Please, please,” she pleaded, and she disarmed me
  7868	by the words, as I was to discover they would ever disarm me.
  7869	
  7870	I stepped back, separating from her, and replaced the knife in its
  7871	sheath.  I looked at Wolf Larsen.  He still pressed his left hand against
  7872	his forehead.  It covered his eyes.  His head was bowed.  He seemed to
  7873	have grown limp.  His body was sagging at the hips, his great shoulders
  7874	were drooping and shrinking forward.
  7875	
  7876	“Van, Weyden!” he called hoarsely, and with a note of fright in his
  7877	voice.  “Oh, Van Weyden! where are you?”
  7878	
  7879	I looked at Maud.  She did not speak, but nodded her head.
  7880	
  7881	“Here I am,” I answered, stepping to his side.  “What is the matter?”
  7882	
  7883	“Help me to a seat,” he said, in the same hoarse, frightened voice.
  7884	
  7885	“I am a sick man; a very sick man, Hump,” he said, as he left my
  7886	sustaining grip and sank into a chair.
  7887	
  7888	His head dropped forward on the table and was buried in his hands.  From
  7889	time to time it rocked back and forward as with pain.  Once, when he half
  7890	raised it, I saw the sweat standing in heavy drops on his forehead about
  7891	the roots of his hair.
  7892	
  7893	“I am a sick man, a very sick man,” he repeated again, and yet once
  7894	again.
  7895	
  7896	“What is the matter?” I asked, resting my hand on his shoulder.  “What
  7897	can I do for you?”
  7898	
  7899	But he shook my hand off with an irritated movement, and for a long time
  7900	I stood by his side in silence.  Maud was looking on, her face awed and
  7901	frightened.  What had happened to him we could not imagine.
  7902	
  7903	“Hump,” he said at last, “I must get into my bunk.  Lend me a hand.  I’ll
  7904	be all right in a little while.  It’s those damn headaches, I believe.  I
  7905	was afraid of them.  I had a feeling—no, I don’t know what I’m talking
  7906	about.  Help me into my bunk.”
  7907	
  7908	But when I got him into his bunk he again buried his face in his hands,
  7909	covering his eyes, and as I turned to go I could hear him murmuring, “I
  7910	am a sick man, a very sick man.”
  7911	
  7912	Maud looked at me inquiringly as I emerged.  I shook my head, saying:
  7913	
  7914	“Something has happened to him.  What, I don’t know.  He is helpless, and
  7915	frightened, I imagine, for the first time in his life.  It must have
  7916	occurred before he received the knife-thrust, which made only a
  7917	superficial wound.  You must have seen what happened.”
  7918	
  7919	She shook her head.  “I saw nothing.  It is just as mysterious to me.  He
  7920	suddenly released me and staggered away.  But what shall we do?  What
  7921	shall I do?”
  7922	
  7923	“If you will wait, please, until I come back,” I answered.
  7924	
  7925	I went on deck.  Louis was at the wheel.
  7926	
  7927	“You may go for’ard and turn in,” I said, taking it from him.
  7928	
  7929	He was quick to obey, and I found myself alone on the deck of the
  7930	_Ghost_.  As quietly as was possible, I clewed up the topsails, lowered
  7931	the flying jib and staysail, backed the jib over, and flattened the
  7932	mainsail.  Then I went below to Maud.  I placed my finger on my lips for
  7933	silence, and entered Wolf Larsen’s room.  He was in the same position in
  7934	which I had left him, and his head was rocking—almost writhing—from side
  7935	to side.
  7936	
  7937	“Anything I can do for you?” I asked.
  7938	
  7939	He made no reply at first, but on my repeating the question he answered,
  7940	“No, no; I’m all right.  Leave me alone till morning.”
  7941	
  7942	But as I turned to go I noted that his head had resumed its rocking
  7943	motion.  Maud was waiting patiently for me, and I took notice, with a
  7944	thrill of joy, of the queenly poise of her head and her glorious, calm
  7945	eyes.  Calm and sure they were as her spirit itself.
  7946	
  7947	“Will you trust yourself to me for a journey of six hundred miles or so?”
  7948	I asked.
  7949	
  7950	“You mean—?” she asked, and I knew she had guessed aright.
  7951	
  7952	“Yes, I mean just that,” I replied.  “There is nothing left for us but
  7953	the open boat.”
  7954	
  7955	“For me, you mean,” she said.  “You are certainly as safe here as you
  7956	have been.”
  7957	
  7958	“No, there is nothing left for us but the open boat,” I iterated stoutly.
  7959	“Will you please dress as warmly as you can, at once, and make into a
  7960	bundle whatever you wish to bring with you.”
  7961	
  7962	“And make all haste,” I added, as she turned toward her state-room.
  7963	
  7964	The lazarette was directly beneath the cabin, and, opening the trap-door
  7965	in the floor and carrying a candle with me, I dropped down and began
  7966	overhauling the ship’s stores.  I selected mainly from the canned goods,
  7967	and by the time I was ready, willing hands were extended from above to
  7968	receive what I passed up.
  7969	
  7970	We worked in silence.  I helped myself also to blankets, mittens,
  7971	oilskins, caps, and such things, from the slop-chest.  It was no light
  7972	adventure, this trusting ourselves in a small boat to so raw and stormy a
  7973	sea, and it was imperative that we should guard ourselves against the
  7974	cold and wet.
  7975	
  7976	We worked feverishly at carrying our plunder on deck and depositing it
  7977	amidships, so feverishly that Maud, whose strength was hardly a positive
  7978	quantity, had to give over, exhausted, and sit on the steps at the break
  7979	of the poop.  This did not serve to recover her, and she lay on her back,
  7980	on the hard deck, arms stretched out, and whole body relaxed.  It was a
  7981	trick I remembered of my sister, and I knew she would soon be herself
  7982	again.  I knew, also, that weapons would not come in amiss, and I
  7983	re-entered Wolf Larsen’s state-room to get his rifle and shot-gun.  I
  7984	spoke to him, but he made no answer, though his head was still rocking
  7985	from side to side and he was not asleep.
  7986	
  7987	“Good-bye, Lucifer,” I whispered to myself as I softly closed the door.
  7988	
  7989	Next to obtain was a stock of ammunition,—an easy matter, though I had to
  7990	enter the steerage companion-way to do it.  Here the hunters stored the
  7991	ammunition-boxes they carried in the boats, and here, but a few feet from
  7992	their noisy revels, I took possession of two boxes.
  7993	
  7994	Next, to lower a boat.  Not so simple a task for one man.  Having cast
  7995	off the lashings, I hoisted first on the forward tackle, then on the aft,
  7996	till the boat cleared the rail, when I lowered away, one tackle and then
  7997	the other, for a couple of feet, till it hung snugly, above the water,
  7998	against the schooner’s side.  I made certain that it contained the proper
  7999	equipment of oars, rowlocks, and sail.  Water was a consideration, and I
  8000	robbed every boat aboard of its breaker.  As there were nine boats all
  8001	told, it meant that we should have plenty of water, and ballast as well,
  8002	though there was the chance that the boat would be overloaded, what of
  8003	the generous supply of other things I was taking.
  8004	
  8005	While Maud was passing me the provisions and I was storing them in the
  8006	boat, a sailor came on deck from the forecastle.  He stood by the weather
  8007	rail for a time (we were lowering over the lee rail), and then sauntered
  8008	slowly amidships, where he again paused and stood facing the wind, with
  8009	his back toward us.  I could hear my heart beating as I crouched low in
  8010	the boat.  Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying
  8011	motionless, her body in the shadow of the bulwark.  But the man never
  8012	turned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning
  8013	audibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.
  8014	
  8015	A few minutes sufficed to finish the loading, and I lowered the boat into
  8016	the water.  As I helped Maud over the rail and felt her form close to
  8017	mine, it was all I could do to keep from crying out, “I love you!  I love
  8018	you!”  Truly Humphrey Van Weyden was at last in love, I thought, as her
  8019	fingers clung to mine while I lowered her down to the boat.  I held on to
  8020	the rail with one hand and supported her weight with the other, and I was
  8021	proud at the moment of the feat.  It was a strength I had not possessed a
  8022	few months before, on the day I said good-bye to Charley Furuseth and
  8023	started for San Francisco on the ill-fated _Martinez_.
  8024	
  8025	As the boat ascended on a sea, her feet touched and I released her hands.
  8026	I cast off the tackles and leaped after her.  I had never rowed in my
  8027	life, but I put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the
  8028	boat clear of the _Ghost_.  Then I experimented with the sail.  I had
  8029	seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times, yet
  8030	this was my first attempt.  What took them possibly two minutes took me
  8031	twenty, but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it, and with
  8032	the steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind.
  8033	
  8034	“There lies Japan,” I remarked, “straight before us.”
  8035	
  8036	“Humphrey Van Weyden,” she said, “you are a brave man.”
  8037	
  8038	“Nay,” I answered, “it is you who are a brave woman.”
  8039	
  8040	We turned our heads, swayed by a common impulse to see the last of the
  8041	_Ghost_.  Her low hull lifted and rolled to windward on a sea; her canvas
  8042	loomed darkly in the night; her lashed wheel creaked as the rudder
  8043	kicked; then sight and sound of her faded away, and we were alone on the
  8044	dark sea.
  8045	
  8046	
  8047	
  8048	
  8049	CHAPTER XXVII
  8050	
  8051	
  8052	Day broke, grey and chill.  The boat was close-hauled on a fresh breeze
  8053	and the compass indicated that we were just making the course which would
  8054	bring us to Japan.  Though stoutly mittened, my fingers were cold, and
  8055	they pained from the grip on the steering-oar.  My feet were stinging
  8056	from the bite of the frost, and I hoped fervently that the sun would
  8057	shine.
  8058	
  8059	Before me, in the bottom of the boat, lay Maud.  She, at least, was warm,
  8060	for under her and over her were thick blankets.  The top one I had drawn
  8061	over her face to shelter it from the night, so I could see nothing but
  8062	the vague shape of her, and her light-brown hair, escaped from the
  8063	covering and jewelled with moisture from the air.
  8064	
  8065	Long I looked at her, dwelling upon that one visible bit of her as only a
  8066	man would who deemed it the most precious thing in the world.  So
  8067	insistent was my gaze that at last she stirred under the blankets, the
  8068	top fold was thrown back and she smiled out on me, her eyes yet heavy
  8069	with sleep.
  8070	
  8071	“Good-morning, Mr. Van Weyden,” she said.  “Have you sighted land yet?”
  8072	
  8073	“No,” I answered, “but we are approaching it at a rate of six miles an
  8074	hour.”
  8075	
  8076	She made a _mouè_ of disappointment.
  8077	
  8078	“But that is equivalent to one hundred and forty-four miles in
  8079	twenty-four hours,” I added reassuringly.
  8080	
  8081	Her face brightened.  “And how far have we to go?”
  8082	
  8083	“Siberia lies off there,” I said, pointing to the west.  “But to the
  8084	south-west, some six hundred miles, is Japan.  If this wind should hold,
  8085	we’ll make it in five days.”
  8086	
  8087	“And if it storms?  The boat could not live?”
  8088	
  8089	She had a way of looking one in the eyes and demanding the truth, and
  8090	thus she looked at me as she asked the question.
  8091	
  8092	“It would have to storm very hard,” I temporized.
  8093	
  8094	“And if it storms very hard?”
  8095	
  8096	I nodded my head.  “But we may be picked up any moment by a
  8097	sealing-schooner.  They are plentifully distributed over this part of the
  8098	ocean.”
  8099	
  8100	“Why, you are chilled through!” she cried.  “Look!  You are shivering.
  8101	Don’t deny it; you are.  And here I have been lying warm as toast.”
  8102	
  8103	“I don’t see that it would help matters if you, too, sat up and were
  8104	chilled,” I laughed.
  8105	
  8106	“It will, though, when I learn to steer, which I certainly shall.”
  8107	
  8108	She sat up and began making her simple toilet.  She shook down her hair,
  8109	and it fell about her in a brown cloud, hiding her face and shoulders.
  8110	Dear, damp brown hair!  I wanted to kiss it, to ripple it through my
  8111	fingers, to bury my face in it.  I gazed entranced, till the boat ran
  8112	into the wind and the flapping sail warned me I was not attending to my
  8113	duties.  Idealist and romanticist that I was and always had been in spite
  8114	of my analytical nature, yet I had failed till now in grasping much of
  8115	the physical characteristics of love.  The love of man and woman, I had
  8116	always held, was a sublimated something related to spirit, a spiritual
  8117	bond that linked and drew their souls together.  The bonds of the flesh
  8118	had little part in my cosmos of love.  But I was learning the sweet
  8119	lesson for myself that the soul transmuted itself, expressed itself,
  8120	through the flesh; that the sight and sense and touch of the loved one’s
  8121	hair was as much breath and voice and essence of the spirit as the light
  8122	that shone from the eyes and the thoughts that fell from the lips.  After
  8123	all, pure spirit was unknowable, a thing to be sensed and divined only;
  8124	nor could it express itself in terms of itself.  Jehovah was
  8125	anthropomorphic because he could address himself to the Jews only in
  8126	terms of their understanding; so he was conceived as in their own image,
  8127	as a cloud, a pillar of fire, a tangible, physical something which the
  8128	mind of the Israelites could grasp.
  8129	
  8130	And so I gazed upon Maud’s light-brown hair, and loved it, and learned
  8131	more of love than all the poets and singers had taught me with all their
  8132	songs and sonnets.  She flung it back with a sudden adroit movement, and
  8133	her face emerged, smiling.
  8134	
  8135	“Why don’t women wear their hair down always?” I asked.  “It is so much
  8136	more beautiful.”
  8137	
  8138	“If it didn’t tangle so dreadfully,” she laughed.  “There!  I’ve lost one
  8139	of my precious hair-pins!”
  8140	
  8141	I neglected the boat and had the sail spilling the wind again and again,
  8142	such was my delight in following her every movement as she searched
  8143	through the blankets for the pin.  I was surprised, and joyfully, that
  8144	she was so much the woman, and the display of each trait and mannerism
  8145	that was characteristically feminine gave me keener joy.  For I had been
  8146	elevating her too highly in my concepts of her, removing her too far from
  8147	the plane of the human, and too far from me.  I had been making of her a
  8148	creature goddess-like and unapproachable.  So I hailed with delight the
  8149	little traits that proclaimed her only woman after all, such as the toss
  8150	of the head which flung back the cloud of hair, and the search for the
  8151	pin.  She was woman, my kind, on my plane, and the delightful intimacy of
  8152	kind, of man and woman, was possible, as well as the reverence and awe in
  8153	which I knew I should always hold her.
  8154	
  8155	She found the pin with an adorable little cry, and I turned my attention
  8156	more fully to my steering.  I proceeded to experiment, lashing and
  8157	wedging the steering-oar until the boat held on fairly well by the wind
  8158	without my assistance.  Occasionally it came up too close, or fell off
  8159	too freely; but it always recovered itself and in the main behaved
  8160	satisfactorily.
  8161	
  8162	“And now we shall have breakfast,” I said.  “But first you must be more
  8163	warmly clad.”
  8164	
  8165	I got out a heavy shirt, new from the slop-chest and made from blanket
  8166	goods.  I knew the kind, so thick and so close of texture that it could
  8167	resist the rain and not be soaked through after hours of wetting.  When
  8168	she had slipped this on over her head, I exchanged the boy’s cap she wore
  8169	for a man’s cap, large enough to cover her hair, and, when the flap was
  8170	turned down, to completely cover her neck and ears.  The effect was
  8171	charming.  Her face was of the sort that cannot but look well under all
  8172	circumstances.  Nothing could destroy its exquisite oval, its well-nigh
  8173	classic lines, its delicately stencilled brows, its large brown eyes,
  8174	clear-seeing and calm, gloriously calm.
  8175	
  8176	A puff, slightly stronger than usual, struck us just then.  The boat was
  8177	caught as it obliquely crossed the crest of a wave.  It went over
  8178	suddenly, burying its gunwale level with the sea and shipping a bucketful
  8179	or so of water.  I was opening a can of tongue at the moment, and I
  8180	sprang to the sheet and cast it off just in time.  The sail flapped and
  8181	fluttered, and the boat paid off.  A few minutes of regulating sufficed
  8182	to put it on its course again, when I returned to the preparation of
  8183	breakfast.
  8184	
  8185	“It does very well, it seems, though I am not versed in things nautical,”
  8186	she said, nodding her head with grave approval at my steering
  8187	contrivance.
  8188	
  8189	“But it will serve only when we are sailing by the wind,” I explained.
  8190	“When running more freely, with the wind astern abeam, or on the quarter,
  8191	it will be necessary for me to steer.”
  8192	
  8193	“I must say I don’t understand your technicalities,” she said, “but I do
  8194	your conclusion, and I don’t like it.  You cannot steer night and day and
  8195	for ever.  So I shall expect, after breakfast, to receive my first
  8196	lesson.  And then you shall lie down and sleep.  We’ll stand watches just
  8197	as they do on ships.”
  8198	
  8199	“I don’t see how I am to teach you,” I made protest.  “I am just learning
  8200	for myself.  You little thought when you trusted yourself to me that I
  8201	had had no experience whatever with small boats.  This is the first time
  8202	I have ever been in one.”
  8203	
  8204	“Then we’ll learn together, sir.  And since you’ve had a night’s start
  8205	you shall teach me what you have learned.  And now, breakfast.  My! this
  8206	air does give one an appetite!”
  8207	
  8208	“No coffee,” I said regretfully, passing her buttered sea-biscuits and a
  8209	slice of canned tongue.  “And there will be no tea, no soups, nothing
  8210	hot, till we have made land somewhere, somehow.”
  8211	
  8212	After the simple breakfast, capped with a cup of cold water, Maud took
  8213	her lesson in steering.  In teaching her I learned quite a deal myself,
  8214	though I was applying the knowledge already acquired by sailing the
  8215	_Ghost_ and by watching the boat-steerers sail the small boats.  She was
  8216	an apt pupil, and soon learned to keep the course, to luff in the puffs
  8217	and to cast off the sheet in an emergency.
  8218	
  8219	Having grown tired, apparently, of the task, she relinquished the oar to
  8220	me.  I had folded up the blankets, but she now proceeded to spread them
  8221	out on the bottom.  When all was arranged snugly, she said:
  8222	
  8223	“Now, sir, to bed.  And you shall sleep until luncheon.  Till
  8224	dinner-time,” she corrected, remembering the arrangement on the _Ghost_.
  8225	
  8226	What could I do?  She insisted, and said, “Please, please,” whereupon I
  8227	turned the oar over to her and obeyed.  I experienced a positive sensuous
  8228	delight as I crawled into the bed she had made with her hands.  The calm
  8229	and control which were so much a part of her seemed to have been
  8230	communicated to the blankets, so that I was aware of a soft dreaminess
  8231	and content, and of an oval face and brown eyes framed in a fisherman’s
  8232	cap and tossing against a background now of grey cloud, now of grey sea,
  8233	and then I was aware that I had been asleep.
  8234	
  8235	I looked at my watch.  It was one o’clock.  I had slept seven hours!  And
  8236	she had been steering seven hours!  When I took the steering-oar I had
  8237	first to unbend her cramped fingers.  Her modicum of strength had been
  8238	exhausted, and she was unable even to move from her position.  I was
  8239	compelled to let go the sheet while I helped her to the nest of blankets
  8240	and chafed her hands and arms.
  8241	
  8242	“I am so tired,” she said, with a quick intake of the breath and a sigh,
  8243	drooping her head wearily.
  8244	
  8245	But she straightened it the next moment.  “Now don’t scold, don’t you
  8246	dare scold,” she cried with mock defiance.
  8247	
  8248	“I hope my face does not appear angry,” I answered seriously; “for I
  8249	assure you I am not in the least angry.”
  8250	
  8251	“N-no,” she considered.  “It looks only reproachful.”
  8252	
  8253	“Then it is an honest face, for it looks what I feel.  You were not fair
  8254	to yourself, nor to me.  How can I ever trust you again?”
  8255	
  8256	She looked penitent.  “I’ll be good,” she said, as a naughty child might
  8257	say it.  “I promise—”
  8258	
  8259	“To obey as a sailor would obey his captain?”
  8260	
  8261	“Yes,” she answered.  “It was stupid of me, I know.”
  8262	
  8263	“Then you must promise something else,” I ventured.
  8264	
  8265	“Readily.”
  8266	
  8267	“That you will not say, ‘Please, please,’ too often; for when you do you
  8268	are sure to override my authority.”
  8269	
  8270	She laughed with amused appreciation.  She, too, had noticed the power of
  8271	the repeated “please.”
  8272	
  8273	“It is a good word—” I began.
  8274	
  8275	“But I must not overwork it,” she broke in.
  8276	
  8277	But she laughed weakly, and her head drooped again.  I left the oar long
  8278	enough to tuck the blankets about her feet and to pull a single fold
  8279	across her face.  Alas! she was not strong.  I looked with misgiving
  8280	toward the south-west and thought of the six hundred miles of hardship
  8281	before us—ay, if it were no worse than hardship.  On this sea a storm
  8282	might blow up at any moment and destroy us.  And yet I was unafraid.  I
  8283	was without confidence in the future, extremely doubtful, and yet I felt
  8284	no underlying fear.  It must come right, it must come right, I repeated
  8285	to myself, over and over again.
  8286	
  8287	The wind freshened in the afternoon, raising a stiffer sea and trying the
  8288	boat and me severely.  But the supply of food and the nine breakers of
  8289	water enabled the boat to stand up to the sea and wind, and I held on as
  8290	long as I dared.  Then I removed the sprit, tightly hauling down the peak
  8291	of the sail, and we raced along under what sailors call a leg-of-mutton.
  8292	
  8293	Late in the afternoon I sighted a steamer’s smoke on the horizon to
  8294	leeward, and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser, or, more likely, the
  8295	_Macedonia_ still seeking the _Ghost_.  The sun had not shone all day,
  8296	and it had been bitter cold.  As night drew on, the clouds darkened and
  8297	the wind freshened, so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our
  8298	mittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs.
  8299	
  8300	By the time it was dark, wind and sea had become too strong for the boat,
  8301	and I reluctantly took in the sail and set about making a drag or
  8302	sea-anchor.  I had learned of the device from the talk of the hunters,
  8303	and it was a simple thing to manufacture.  Furling the sail and lashing
  8304	it securely about the mast, boom, sprit, and two pairs of spare oars, I
  8305	threw it overboard.  A line connected it with the bow, and as it floated
  8306	low in the water, practically unexposed to the wind, it drifted less
  8307	rapidly than the boat.  In consequence it held the boat bow on to the sea
  8308	and wind—the safest position in which to escape being swamped when the
  8309	sea is breaking into whitecaps.
  8310	
  8311	“And now?” Maud asked cheerfully, when the task was accomplished and I
  8312	pulled on my mittens.
  8313	
  8314	“And now we are no longer travelling toward Japan,” I answered.  “Our
  8315	drift is to the south-east, or south-south-east, at the rate of at least
  8316	two miles an hour.”
  8317	
  8318	“That will be only twenty-four miles,” she urged, “if the wind remains
  8319	high all night.”
  8320	
  8321	“Yes, and only one hundred and forty miles if it continues for three days
  8322	and nights.”
  8323	
  8324	“But it won’t continue,” she said with easy confidence.  “It will turn
  8325	around and blow fair.”
  8326	
  8327	“The sea is the great faithless one.”
  8328	
  8329	“But the wind!” she retorted.  “I have heard you grow eloquent over the
  8330	brave trade-wind.”
  8331	
  8332	“I wish I had thought to bring Wolf Larsen’s chronometer and sextant,” I
  8333	said, still gloomily.  “Sailing one direction, drifting another
  8334	direction, to say nothing of the set of the current in some third
  8335	direction, makes a resultant which dead reckoning can never calculate.
  8336	Before long we won’t know where we are by five hundred miles.”
  8337	
  8338	Then I begged her pardon and promised I should not be disheartened any
  8339	more.  At her solicitation I let her take the watch till midnight,—it was
  8340	then nine o’clock, but I wrapped her in blankets and put an oilskin about
  8341	her before I lay down.  I slept only cat-naps.  The boat was leaping and
  8342	pounding as it fell over the crests, I could hear the seas rushing past,
  8343	and spray was continually being thrown aboard.  And still, it was not a
  8344	bad night, I mused—nothing to the nights I had been through on the
  8345	_Ghost_; nothing, perhaps, to the nights we should go through in this
  8346	cockle-shell.  Its planking was three-quarters of an inch thick.  Between
  8347	us and the bottom of the sea was less than an inch of wood.
  8348	
  8349	And yet, I aver it, and I aver it again, I was unafraid.  The death which
  8350	Wolf Larsen and even Thomas Mugridge had made me fear, I no longer
  8351	feared.  The coming of Maud Brewster into my life seemed to have
  8352	transformed me.  After all, I thought, it is better and finer to love
  8353	than to be loved, if it makes something in life so worth while that one
  8354	is not loath to die for it.  I forget my own life in the love of another
  8355	life; and yet, such is the paradox, I never wanted so much to live as
  8356	right now when I place the least value upon my own life.  I never had so
  8357	much reason for living, was my concluding thought; and after that, until
  8358	I dozed, I contented myself with trying to pierce the darkness to where I
  8359	knew Maud crouched low in the stern-sheets, watchful of the foaming sea
  8360	and ready to call me on an instant’s notice.
  8361	
  8362	
  8363	
  8364	
  8365	CHAPTER XXVIII
  8366	
  8367	
  8368	There is no need of going into an extended recital of our suffering in
  8369	the small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted, here and
  8370	there, willy-nilly, across the ocean.  The high wind blew from the
  8371	north-west for twenty-four hours, when it fell calm, and in the night
  8372	sprang up from the south-west.  This was dead in our teeth, but I took in
  8373	the sea-anchor and set sail, hauling a course on the wind which took us
  8374	in a south-south-easterly direction.  It was an even choice between this
  8375	and the west-north-westerly course which the wind permitted; but the warm
  8376	airs of the south fanned my desire for a warmer sea and swayed my
  8377	decision.
  8378	
  8379	In three hours—it was midnight, I well remember, and as dark as I had
  8380	ever seen it on the sea—the wind, still blowing out of the south-west,
  8381	rose furiously, and once again I was compelled to set the sea-anchor.
  8382	
  8383	Day broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white, the boat
  8384	pitching, almost on end, to its drag.  We were in imminent danger of
  8385	being swamped by the whitecaps.  As it was, spray and spume came aboard
  8386	in such quantities that I bailed without cessation.  The blankets were
  8387	soaking.  Everything was wet except Maud, and she, in oilskins, rubber
  8388	boots, and sou’wester, was dry, all but her face and hands and a stray
  8389	wisp of hair.  She relieved me at the bailing-hole from time to time, and
  8390	bravely she threw out the water and faced the storm.  All things are
  8391	relative.  It was no more than a stiff blow, but to us, fighting for life
  8392	in our frail craft, it was indeed a storm.
  8393	
  8394	Cold and cheerless, the wind beating on our faces, the white seas roaring
  8395	by, we struggled through the day.  Night came, but neither of us slept.
  8396	Day came, and still the wind beat on our faces and the white seas roared
  8397	past.  By the second night Maud was falling asleep from exhaustion.  I
  8398	covered her with oilskins and a tarpaulin.  She was comparatively dry,
  8399	but she was numb with the cold.  I feared greatly that she might die in
  8400	the night; but day broke, cold and cheerless, with the same clouded sky
  8401	and beating wind and roaring seas.
  8402	
  8403	I had had no sleep for forty-eight hours.  I was wet and chilled to the
  8404	marrow, till I felt more dead than alive.  My body was stiff from
  8405	exertion as well as from cold, and my aching muscles gave me the severest
  8406	torture whenever I used them, and I used them continually.  And all the
  8407	time we were being driven off into the north-east, directly away from
  8408	Japan and toward bleak Bering Sea.
  8409	
  8410	And still we lived, and the boat lived, and the wind blew unabated.  In
  8411	fact, toward nightfall of the third day it increased a trifle and
  8412	something more.  The boat’s bow plunged under a crest, and we came
  8413	through quarter-full of water.  I bailed like a madman.  The liability of
  8414	shipping another such sea was enormously increased by the water that
  8415	weighed the boat down and robbed it of its buoyancy.  And another such
  8416	sea meant the end.  When I had the boat empty again I was forced to take
  8417	away the tarpaulin which covered Maud, in order that I might lash it down
  8418	across the bow.  It was well I did, for it covered the boat fully a third
  8419	of the way aft, and three times, in the next several hours, it flung off
  8420	the bulk of the down-rushing water when the bow shoved under the seas.
  8421	
  8422	Maud’s condition was pitiable.  She sat crouched in the bottom of the
  8423	boat, her lips blue, her face grey and plainly showing the pain she
  8424	suffered.  But ever her eyes looked bravely at me, and ever her lips
  8425	uttered brave words.
  8426	
  8427	The worst of the storm must have blown that night, though little I
  8428	noticed it.  I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets.
  8429	The morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle
  8430	whisper, the sea dying down and the sun shining upon us.  Oh, the blessed
  8431	sun!  How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious warmth, reviving
  8432	like bugs and crawling things after a storm.  We smiled again, said
  8433	amusing things, and waxed optimistic over our situation.  Yet it was, if
  8434	anything, worse than ever.  We were farther from Japan than the night we
  8435	left the _Ghost_.  Nor could I more than roughly guess our latitude and
  8436	longitude.  At a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour, during the
  8437	seventy and odd hours of the storm, we had been driven at least one
  8438	hundred and fifty miles to the north-east.  But was such calculated drift
  8439	correct?  For all I knew, it might have been four miles per hour instead
  8440	of two.  In which case we were another hundred and fifty miles to the
  8441	bad.
  8442	
  8443	Where we were I did not know, though there was quite a likelihood that we
  8444	were in the vicinity of the _Ghost_.  There were seals about us, and I
  8445	was prepared to sight a sealing-schooner at any time.  We did sight one,
  8446	in the afternoon, when the north-west breeze had sprung up freshly once
  8447	more.  But the strange schooner lost itself on the sky-line and we alone
  8448	occupied the circle of the sea.
  8449	
  8450	Came days of fog, when even Maud’s spirit drooped and there were no merry
  8451	words upon her lips; days of calm, when we floated on the lonely
  8452	immensity of sea, oppressed by its greatness and yet marvelling at the
  8453	miracle of tiny life, for we still lived and struggled to live; days of
  8454	sleet and wind and snow-squalls, when nothing could keep us warm; or days
  8455	of drizzling rain, when we filled our water-breakers from the drip of the
  8456	wet sail.
  8457	
  8458	And ever I loved Maud with an increasing love.  She was so many-sided, so
  8459	many-mooded—“protean-mooded” I called her.  But I called her this, and
  8460	other and dearer things, in my thoughts only.  Though the declaration of
  8461	my love urged and trembled on my tongue a thousand times, I knew that it
  8462	was no time for such a declaration.  If for no other reason, it was no
  8463	time, when one was protecting and trying to save a woman, to ask that
  8464	woman for her love.  Delicate as was the situation, not alone in this but
  8465	in other ways, I flattered myself that I was able to deal delicately with
  8466	it; and also I flattered myself that by look or sign I gave no
  8467	advertisement of the love I felt for her.  We were like good comrades,
  8468	and we grew better comrades as the days went by.
  8469	
  8470	One thing about her which surprised me was her lack of timidity and fear.
  8471	The terrible sea, the frail boat, the storms, the suffering, the
  8472	strangeness and isolation of the situation,—all that should have
  8473	frightened a robust woman,—seemed to make no impression upon her who had
  8474	known life only in its most sheltered and consummately artificial
  8475	aspects, and who was herself all fire and dew and mist, sublimated
  8476	spirit, all that was soft and tender and clinging in woman.  And yet I am
  8477	wrong.  She _was_ timid and afraid, but she possessed courage.  The flesh
  8478	and the qualms of the flesh she was heir to, but the flesh bore heavily
  8479	only on the flesh.  And she was spirit, first and always spirit,
  8480	etherealized essence of life, calm as her calm eyes, and sure of
  8481	permanence in the changing order of the universe.
  8482	
  8483	Came days of storm, days and nights of storm, when the ocean menaced us
  8484	with its roaring whiteness, and the wind smote our struggling boat with a
  8485	Titan’s buffets.  And ever we were flung off, farther and farther, to the
  8486	north-east.  It was in such a storm, and the worst that we had
  8487	experienced, that I cast a weary glance to leeward, not in quest of
  8488	anything, but more from the weariness of facing the elemental strife, and
  8489	in mute appeal, almost, to the wrathful powers to cease and let us be.
  8490	What I saw I could not at first believe.  Days and nights of
  8491	sleeplessness and anxiety had doubtless turned my head.  I looked back at
  8492	Maud, to identify myself, as it were, in time and space.  The sight of
  8493	her dear wet cheeks, her flying hair, and her brave brown eyes convinced
  8494	me that my vision was still healthy.  Again I turned my face to leeward,
  8495	and again I saw the jutting promontory, black and high and naked, the
  8496	raging surf that broke about its base and beat its front high up with
  8497	spouting fountains, the black and forbidden coast-line running toward the
  8498	south-east and fringed with a tremendous scarf of white.
  8499	
  8500	“Maud,” I said.  “Maud.”
  8501	
  8502	She turned her head and beheld the sight.
  8503	
  8504	“It cannot be Alaska!” she cried.
  8505	
  8506	“Alas, no,” I answered, and asked, “Can you swim?”
  8507	
  8508	She shook her head.
  8509	
  8510	“Neither can I,” I said.  “So we must get ashore without swimming, in
  8511	some opening between the rocks through which we can drive the boat and
  8512	clamber out.  But we must be quick, most quick—and sure.”
  8513	
  8514	I spoke with a confidence she knew I did not feel, for she looked at me
  8515	with that unfaltering gaze of hers and said:
  8516	
  8517	“I have not thanked you yet for all you have done for me but—”
  8518	
  8519	She hesitated, as if in doubt how best to word her gratitude.
  8520	
  8521	“Well?” I said, brutally, for I was not quite pleased with her thanking
  8522	me.
  8523	
  8524	“You might help me,” she smiled.
  8525	
  8526	“To acknowledge your obligations before you die?  Not at all.  We are not
  8527	going to die.  We shall land on that island, and we shall be snug and
  8528	sheltered before the day is done.”
  8529	
  8530	I spoke stoutly, but I did not believe a word.  Nor was I prompted to lie
  8531	through fear.  I felt no fear, though I was sure of death in that boiling
  8532	surge amongst the rocks which was rapidly growing nearer.  It was
  8533	impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore.  The wind would
  8534	instantly capsize the boat; the seas would swamp it the moment it fell
  8535	into the trough; and, besides, the sail, lashed to the spare oars,
  8536	dragged in the sea ahead of us.
  8537	
  8538	As I say, I was not afraid to meet my own death, there, a few hundred
  8539	yards to leeward; but I was appalled at the thought that Maud must die.
  8540	My cursed imagination saw her beaten and mangled against the rocks, and
  8541	it was too terrible.  I strove to compel myself to think we would make
  8542	the landing safely, and so I spoke, not what I believed, but what I
  8543	preferred to believe.
  8544	
  8545	I recoiled before contemplation of that frightful death, and for a moment
  8546	I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud in my arms and leaping
  8547	overboard.  Then I resolved to wait, and at the last moment, when we
  8548	entered on the final stretch, to take her in my arms and proclaim my
  8549	love, and, with her in my embrace, to make the desperate struggle and
  8550	die.
  8551	
  8552	Instinctively we drew closer together in the bottom of the boat.  I felt
  8553	her mittened hand come out to mine.  And thus, without speech, we waited
  8554	the end.  We were not far off the line the wind made with the western
  8555	edge of the promontory, and I watched in the hope that some set of the
  8556	current or send of the sea would drift us past before we reached the
  8557	surf.
  8558	
  8559	“We shall go clear,” I said, with a confidence which I knew deceived
  8560	neither of us.
  8561	
  8562	“By God, we _will_ go clear!” I cried, five minutes later.
  8563	
  8564	The oath left my lips in my excitement—the first, I do believe, in my
  8565	life, unless “trouble it,” an expletive of my youth, be accounted an
  8566	oath.
  8567	
  8568	“I beg your pardon,” I said.
  8569	
  8570	“You have convinced me of your sincerity,” she said, with a faint smile.
  8571	“I do know, now, that we shall go clear.”
  8572	
  8573	I had seen a distant headland past the extreme edge of the promontory,
  8574	and as we looked we could see grow the intervening coastline of what was
  8575	evidently a deep cove.  At the same time there broke upon our ears a
  8576	continuous and mighty bellowing.  It partook of the magnitude and volume
  8577	of distant thunder, and it came to us directly from leeward, rising above
  8578	the crash of the surf and travelling directly in the teeth of the storm.
  8579	As we passed the point the whole cove burst upon our view, a half-moon of
  8580	white sandy beach upon which broke a huge surf, and which was covered
  8581	with myriads of seals.  It was from them that the great bellowing went
  8582	up.
  8583	
  8584	“A rookery!” I cried.  “Now are we indeed saved.  There must be men and
  8585	cruisers to protect them from the seal-hunters.  Possibly there is a
  8586	station ashore.”
  8587	
  8588	But as I studied the surf which beat upon the beach, I said, “Still bad,
  8589	but not so bad.  And now, if the gods be truly kind, we shall drift by
  8590	that next headland and come upon a perfectly sheltered beach, where we
  8591	may land without wetting our feet.”
  8592	
  8593	And the gods were kind.  The first and second headlands were directly in
  8594	line with the south-west wind; but once around the second,—and we went
  8595	perilously near,—we picked up the third headland, still in line with the
  8596	wind and with the other two.  But the cove that intervened!  It
  8597	penetrated deep into the land, and the tide, setting in, drifted us under
  8598	the shelter of the point.  Here the sea was calm, save for a heavy but
  8599	smooth ground-swell, and I took in the sea-anchor and began to row.  From
  8600	the point the shore curved away, more and more to the south and west,
  8601	until at last it disclosed a cove within the cove, a little land-locked
  8602	harbour, the water level as a pond, broken only by tiny ripples where
  8603	vagrant breaths and wisps of the storm hurtled down from over the
  8604	frowning wall of rock that backed the beach a hundred feet inshore.
  8605	
  8606	Here were no seals whatever.  The boat’s stern touched the hard shingle.
  8607	I sprang out, extending my hand to Maud.  The next moment she was beside
  8608	me.  As my fingers released hers, she clutched for my arm hastily.  At
  8609	the same moment I swayed, as about to fall to the sand.  This was the
  8610	startling effect of the cessation of motion.  We had been so long upon
  8611	the moving, rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us.  We
  8612	expected the beach to lift up this way and that, and the rocky walls to
  8613	swing back and forth like the sides of a ship; and when we braced
  8614	ourselves, automatically, for these various expected movements, their
  8615	non-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium.
  8616	
  8617	“I really must sit down,” Maud said, with a nervous laugh and a dizzy
  8618	gesture, and forthwith she sat down on the sand.
  8619	
  8620	I attended to making the boat secure and joined her.  Thus we landed on
  8621	Endeavour Island, as we came to it, land-sick from long custom of the
  8622	sea.
  8623	
  8624	
  8625	
  8626	
  8627	CHAPTER XXIX
  8628	
  8629	
  8630	“Fool!” I cried aloud in my vexation.
  8631	
  8632	I had unloaded the boat and carried its contents high up on the beach,
  8633	where I had set about making a camp.  There was driftwood, though not
  8634	much, on the beach, and the sight of a coffee tin I had taken from the
  8635	_Ghost’s_ larder had given me the idea of a fire.
  8636	
  8637	“Blithering idiot!” I was continuing.
  8638	
  8639	But Maud said, “Tut, tut,” in gentle reproval, and then asked why I was a
  8640	blithering idiot.
  8641	
  8642	“No matches,” I groaned.  “Not a match did I bring.  And now we shall
  8643	have no hot coffee, soup, tea, or anything!”
  8644	
  8645	“Wasn’t it—er—Crusoe who rubbed sticks together?” she drawled.
  8646	
  8647	“But I have read the personal narratives of a score of shipwrecked men
  8648	who tried, and tried in vain,” I answered.  “I remember Winters, a
  8649	newspaper fellow with an Alaskan and Siberian reputation.  Met him at the
  8650	Bibelot once, and he was telling us how he attempted to make a fire with
  8651	a couple of sticks.  It was most amusing.  He told it inimitably, but it
  8652	was the story of a failure.  I remember his conclusion, his black eyes
  8653	flashing as he said, ‘Gentlemen, the South Sea Islander may do it, the
  8654	Malay may do it, but take my word it’s beyond the white man.’”
  8655	
  8656	“Oh, well, we’ve managed so far without it,” she said cheerfully.  “And
  8657	there’s no reason why we cannot still manage without it.”
  8658	
  8659	“But think of the coffee!” I cried.  “It’s good coffee, too, I know.  I
  8660	took it from Larsen’s private stores.  And look at that good wood.”
  8661	
  8662	I confess, I wanted the coffee badly; and I learned, not long afterward,
  8663	that the berry was likewise a little weakness of Maud’s.  Besides, we had
  8664	been so long on a cold diet that we were numb inside as well as out.
  8665	Anything warm would have been most gratifying.  But I complained no more
  8666	and set about making a tent of the sail for Maud.
  8667	
  8668	I had looked upon it as a simple task, what of the oars, mast, boom, and
  8669	sprit, to say nothing of plenty of lines.  But as I was without
  8670	experience, and as every detail was an experiment and every successful
  8671	detail an invention, the day was well gone before her shelter was an
  8672	accomplished fact.  And then, that night, it rained, and she was flooded
  8673	out and driven back into the boat.
  8674	
  8675	The next morning I dug a shallow ditch around the tent, and, an hour
  8676	later, a sudden gust of wind, whipping over the rocky wall behind us,
  8677	picked up the tent and smashed it down on the sand thirty yards away.
  8678	
  8679	Maud laughed at my crestfallen expression, and I said, “As soon as the
  8680	wind abates I intend going in the boat to explore the island.  There must
  8681	be a station somewhere, and men.  And ships must visit the station.  Some
  8682	Government must protect all these seals.  But I wish to have you
  8683	comfortable before I start.”
  8684	
  8685	“I should like to go with you,” was all she said.
  8686	
  8687	“It would be better if you remained.  You have had enough of hardship.
  8688	It is a miracle that you have survived.  And it won’t be comfortable in
  8689	the boat rowing and sailing in this rainy weather.  What you need is
  8690	rest, and I should like you to remain and get it.”
  8691	
  8692	Something suspiciously akin to moistness dimmed her beautiful eyes before
  8693	she dropped them and partly turned away her head.
  8694	
  8695	“I should prefer going with you,” she said in a low voice, in which there
  8696	was just a hint of appeal.
  8697	
  8698	“I might be able to help you a—” her voice broke,—“a little.  And if
  8699	anything should happen to you, think of me left here alone.”
  8700	
  8701	“Oh, I intend being very careful,” I answered.  “And I shall not go so
  8702	far but what I can get back before night.  Yes, all said and done, I
  8703	think it vastly better for you to remain, and sleep, and rest and do
  8704	nothing.”
  8705	
  8706	She turned and looked me in the eyes.  Her gaze was unfaltering, but
  8707	soft.
  8708	
  8709	“Please, please,” she said, oh, so softly.
  8710	
  8711	I stiffened myself to refuse, and shook my head.  Still she waited and
  8712	looked at me.  I tried to word my refusal, but wavered.  I saw the glad
  8713	light spring into her eyes and knew that I had lost.  It was impossible
  8714	to say no after that.
  8715	
  8716	The wind died down in the afternoon, and we were prepared to start the
  8717	following morning.  There was no way of penetrating the island from our
  8718	cove, for the walls rose perpendicularly from the beach, and, on either
  8719	side of the cove, rose from the deep water.
  8720	
  8721	Morning broke dull and grey, but calm, and I was awake early and had the
  8722	boat in readiness.
  8723	
  8724	“Fool!  Imbecile!  Yahoo!” I shouted, when I thought it was meet to
  8725	arouse Maud; but this time I shouted in merriment as I danced about the
  8726	beach, bareheaded, in mock despair.
  8727	
  8728	Her head appeared under the flap of the sail.
  8729	
  8730	“What now?” she asked sleepily, and, withal, curiously.
  8731	
  8732	“Coffee!” I cried.  “What do you say to a cup of coffee? hot coffee?
  8733	piping hot?”
  8734	
  8735	“My!” she murmured, “you startled me, and you are cruel.  Here I have
  8736	been composing my soul to do without it, and here you are vexing me with
  8737	your vain suggestions.”
  8738	
  8739	“Watch me,” I said.
  8740	
  8741	From under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks and chips.
  8742	These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling.  From my note-book
  8743	I tore out a page, and from the ammunition box took a shot-gun shell.
  8744	Removing the wads from the latter with my knife, I emptied the powder on
  8745	a flat rock.  Next I pried the primer, or cap, from the shell, and laid
  8746	it on the rock, in the midst of the scattered powder.  All was ready.
  8747	Maud still watched from the tent.  Holding the paper in my left hand, I
  8748	smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right.  There was a puff
  8749	of white smoke, a burst of flame, and the rough edge of the paper was
  8750	alight.
  8751	
  8752	Maud clapped her hands gleefully.  “Prometheus!” she cried.
  8753	
  8754	But I was too occupied to acknowledge her delight.  The feeble flame must
  8755	be cherished tenderly if it were to gather strength and live.  I fed it,
  8756	shaving by shaving, and sliver by sliver, till at last it was snapping
  8757	and crackling as it laid hold of the smaller chips and sticks.  To be
  8758	cast away on an island had not entered into my calculations, so we were
  8759	without a kettle or cooking utensils of any sort; but I made shift with
  8760	the tin used for bailing the boat, and later, as we consumed our supply
  8761	of canned goods, we accumulated quite an imposing array of cooking
  8762	vessels.
  8763	
  8764	I boiled the water, but it was Maud who made the coffee.  And how good it
  8765	was!  My contribution was canned beef fried with crumbled sea-biscuit and
  8766	water.  The breakfast was a success, and we sat about the fire much
  8767	longer than enterprising explorers should have done, sipping the hot
  8768	black coffee and talking over our situation.
  8769	
  8770	I was confident that we should find a station in some one of the coves,
  8771	for I knew that the rookeries of Bering Sea were thus guarded; but Maud
  8772	advanced the theory—to prepare me for disappointment, I do believe, if
  8773	disappointment were to come—that we had discovered an unknown rookery.
  8774	She was in very good spirits, however, and made quite merry in accepting
  8775	our plight as a grave one.
  8776	
  8777	“If you are right,” I said, “then we must prepare to winter here.  Our
  8778	food will not last, but there are the seals.  They go away in the fall,
  8779	so I must soon begin to lay in a supply of meat.  Then there will be huts
  8780	to build and driftwood to gather.  Also we shall try out seal fat for
  8781	lighting purposes.  Altogether, we’ll have our hands full if we find the
  8782	island uninhabited.  Which we shall not, I know.”
  8783	
  8784	But she was right.  We sailed with a beam wind along the shore, searching
  8785	the coves with our glasses and landing occasionally, without finding a
  8786	sign of human life.  Yet we learned that we were not the first who had
  8787	landed on Endeavour Island.  High up on the beach of the second cove from
  8788	ours, we discovered the splintered wreck of a boat—a sealer’s boat, for
  8789	the rowlocks were bound in sennit, a gun-rack was on the starboard side
  8790	of the bow, and in white letters was faintly visible _Gazelle_ No. 2.
  8791	The boat had lain there for a long time, for it was half filled with
  8792	sand, and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to
  8793	long exposure to the elements.  In the stern-sheets I found a rusty
  8794	ten-gauge shot-gun and a sailor’s sheath-knife broken short across and so
  8795	rusted as to be almost unrecognizable.
  8796	
  8797	“They got away,” I said cheerfully; but I felt a sinking at the heart and
  8798	seemed to divine the presence of bleached bones somewhere on that beach.
  8799	
  8800	I did not wish Maud’s spirits to be dampened by such a find, so I turned
  8801	seaward again with our boat and skirted the north-eastern point of the
  8802	island.  There were no beaches on the southern shore, and by early
  8803	afternoon we rounded the black promontory and completed the
  8804	circumnavigation of the island.  I estimated its circumference at
  8805	twenty-five miles, its width as varying from two to five miles; while my
  8806	most conservative calculation placed on its beaches two hundred thousand
  8807	seals.  The island was highest at its extreme south-western point, the
  8808	headlands and backbone diminishing regularly until the north-eastern
  8809	portion was only a few feet above the sea.  With the exception of our
  8810	little cove, the other beaches sloped gently back for a distance of
  8811	half-a-mile or so, into what I might call rocky meadows, with here and
  8812	there patches of moss and tundra grass.  Here the seals hauled out, and
  8813	the old bulls guarded their harems, while the young bulls hauled out by
  8814	themselves.
  8815	
  8816	This brief description is all that Endeavour Island merits.  Damp and
  8817	soggy where it was not sharp and rocky, buffeted by storm winds and
  8818	lashed by the sea, with the air continually a-tremble with the bellowing
  8819	of two hundred thousand amphibians, it was a melancholy and miserable
  8820	sojourning-place.  Maud, who had prepared me for disappointment, and who
  8821	had been sprightly and vivacious all day, broke down as we landed in our
  8822	own little cove.  She strove bravely to hide it from me, but while I was
  8823	kindling another fire I knew she was stifling her sobs in the blankets
  8824	under the sail-tent.
  8825	
  8826	It was my turn to be cheerful, and I played the part to the best of my
  8827	ability, and with such success that I brought the laughter back into her
  8828	dear eyes and song on her lips; for she sang to me before she went to an
  8829	early bed.  It was the first time I had heard her sing, and I lay by the
  8830	fire, listening and transported, for she was nothing if not an artist in
  8831	everything she did, and her voice, though not strong, was wonderfully
  8832	sweet and expressive.
  8833	
  8834	I still slept in the boat, and I lay awake long that night, gazing up at
  8835	the first stars I had seen in many nights and pondering the situation.
  8836	Responsibility of this sort was a new thing to me.  Wolf Larsen had been
  8837	quite right.  I had stood on my father’s legs.  My lawyers and agents had
  8838	taken care of my money for me.  I had had no responsibilities at all.
  8839	Then, on the _Ghost_ I had learned to be responsible for myself.  And
  8840	now, for the first time in my life, I found myself responsible for some
  8841	one else.  And it was required of me that this should be the gravest of
  8842	responsibilities, for she was the one woman in the world—the one small
  8843	woman, as I loved to think of her.
  8844

  8848	CHAPTER XXX
  8849	
  8850	
  8851	No wonder we called it Endeavour Island.  For two weeks we toiled at
  8852	building a hut.  Maud insisted on helping, and I could have wept over her
  8853	bruised and bleeding hands.  And still, I was proud of her because of it.
  8854	There was something heroic about this gently-bred woman enduring our
  8855	terrible hardship and with her pittance of strength bending to the tasks
  8856	of a peasant woman.  She gathered many of the stones which I built into
  8857	the walls of the hut; also, she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I
  8858	begged her to desist.  She compromised, however, by taking upon herself
  8859	the lighter labours of cooking and gathering driftwood and moss for our
  8860	winter’s supply.
  8861	
  8862	The hut’s walls rose without difficulty, and everything went smoothly
  8863	until the problem of the roof confronted me.  Of what use the four walls
  8864	without a roof?  And of what could a roof be made?  There were the spare
  8865	oars, very true.  They would serve as roof-beams; but with what was I to
  8866	cover them?  Moss would never do.  Tundra grass was impracticable.  We
  8867	needed the sail for the boat, and the tarpaulin had begun to leak.
  8868	
  8869	“Winters used walrus skins on his hut,” I said.
  8870	
  8871	“There are the seals,” she suggested.
  8872	
  8873	So next day the hunting began.  I did not know how to shoot, but I
  8874	proceeded to learn.  And when I had expended some thirty shells for three
  8875	seals, I decided that the ammunition would be exhausted before I acquired
  8876	the necessary knowledge.  I had used eight shells for lighting fires
  8877	before I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss, and
  8878	there remained not over a hundred shells in the box.
  8879	
  8880	“We must club the seals,” I announced, when convinced of my poor
  8881	marksmanship.  “I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them.”
  8882	
  8883	“They are so pretty,” she objected.  “I cannot bear to think of it being
  8884	done.  It is so directly brutal, you know; so different from shooting
  8885	them.”
  8886	
  8887	“That roof must go on,” I answered grimly.  “Winter is almost here.  It
  8888	is our lives against theirs.  It is unfortunate we haven’t plenty of
  8889	ammunition, but I think, anyway, that they suffer less from being clubbed
  8890	than from being all shot up.  Besides, I shall do the clubbing.”
  8891	
  8892	“That’s just it,” she began eagerly, and broke off in sudden confusion.
  8893	
  8894	“Of course,” I began, “if you prefer—”
  8895	
  8896	“But what shall I be doing?” she interrupted, with that softness I knew
  8897	full well to be insistence.
  8898	
  8899	“Gathering firewood and cooking dinner,” I answered lightly.
  8900	
  8901	She shook her head.  “It is too dangerous for you to attempt alone.”
  8902	
  8903	“I know, I know,” she waived my protest.  “I am only a weak woman, but
  8904	just my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster.”
  8905	
  8906	“But the clubbing?” I suggested.
  8907	
  8908	“Of course, you will do that.  I shall probably scream.  I’ll look away
  8909	when—”
  8910	
  8911	“The danger is most serious,” I laughed.
  8912	
  8913	“I shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look,” she replied
  8914	with a grand air.
  8915	
  8916	The upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning.  I
  8917	rowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach.  There
  8918	were seals all about us in the water, and the bellowing thousands on the
  8919	beach compelled us to shout at each other to make ourselves heard.
  8920	
  8921	“I know men club them,” I said, trying to reassure myself, and gazing
  8922	doubtfully at a large bull, not thirty feet away, upreared on his
  8923	fore-flippers and regarding me intently.  “But the question is, How do
  8924	they club them?”
  8925	
  8926	“Let us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof,” Maud said.
  8927	
  8928	She was as frightened as I at the prospect, and we had reason to be
  8929	gazing at close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like mouths.
  8930	
  8931	“I always thought they were afraid of men,” I said.
  8932	
  8933	“How do I know they are not afraid?” I queried a moment later, after
  8934	having rowed a few more strokes along the beach.  “Perhaps, if I were to
  8935	step boldly ashore, they would cut for it, and I could not catch up with
  8936	one.”  And still I hesitated.
  8937	
  8938	“I heard of a man, once, who invaded the nesting grounds of wild geese,”
  8939	Maud said.  “They killed him.”
  8940	
  8941	“The geese?”
  8942	
  8943	“Yes, the geese.  My brother told me about it when I was a little girl.”
  8944	
  8945	“But I know men club them,” I persisted.
  8946	
  8947	“I think the tundra grass will make just as good a roof,” she said.
  8948	
  8949	Far from her intention, her words were maddening me, driving me on.  I
  8950	could not play the coward before her eyes.  “Here goes,” I said, backing
  8951	water with one oar and running the bow ashore.
  8952	
  8953	I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst
  8954	of his wives.  I was armed with the regular club with which the
  8955	boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters.  It
  8956	was only a foot and a half long, and in my superb ignorance I never
  8957	dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured
  8958	four to five feet.  The cows lumbered out of my way, and the distance
  8959	between me and the bull decreased.  He raised himself on his flippers
  8960	with an angry movement.  We were a dozen feet apart.  Still I advanced
  8961	steadily, looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run.
  8962	
  8963	At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind, What if he will not
  8964	run?  Why, then I shall club him, came the answer.  In my fear I had
  8965	forgotten that I was there to get the bull instead of to make him run.
  8966	And just then he gave a snort and a snarl and rushed at me.  His eyes
  8967	were blazing, his mouth was wide open; the teeth gleamed cruelly white.
  8968	Without shame, I confess that it was I who turned and footed it.  He ran
  8969	awkwardly, but he ran well.  He was but two paces behind when I tumbled
  8970	into the boat, and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down
  8971	upon the blade.  The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell.  Maud and
  8972	I were astounded.  A moment later he had dived under the boat, seized the
  8973	keel in his mouth, and was shaking the boat violently.
  8974	
  8975	“My!” said Maud.  “Let’s go back.”
  8976	
  8977	I shook my head.  “I can do what other men have done, and I know that
  8978	other men have clubbed seals.  But I think I’ll leave the bulls alone
  8979	next time.”
  8980	
  8981	“I wish you wouldn’t,” she said.
  8982	
  8983	“Now don’t say, ‘Please, please,’” I cried, half angrily, I do believe.
  8984	
  8985	She made no reply, and I knew my tone must have hurt her.
  8986	
  8987	“I beg your pardon,” I said, or shouted, rather, in order to make myself
  8988	heard above the roar of the rookery.  “If you say so, I’ll turn and go
  8989	back; but honestly, I’d rather stay.”
  8990	
  8991	“Now don’t say that this is what you get for bringing a woman along,” she
  8992	said.  She smiled at me whimsically, gloriously, and I knew there was no
  8993	need for forgiveness.
  8994	
  8995	I rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover my
  8996	nerves, and then stepped ashore again.
  8997	
  8998	“Do be cautious,” she called after me.
  8999	
  9000	I nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the nearest
  9001	harem.  All went well until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow's head and
  9002	fell short.  She snorted and tried to scramble away.  I ran in close and
  9003	struck another blow, hitting the shoulder instead of the head.
  9004	
  9005	“Watch out!” I heard Maud scream.
  9006	
  9007	In my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things, and I
  9008	looked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon me.  Again I
  9009	fled to the boat, hotly pursued; but this time Maud made no suggestion of
  9010	turning back.
  9011	
  9012	“It would be better, I imagine, if you let harems alone and devoted your
  9013	attention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals,” was what she said.
  9014	“I think I have read something about them.  Dr. Jordan’s book, I believe.
  9015	They are the young bulls, not old enough to have harems of their own.  He
  9016	called them the holluschickie, or something like that.  It seems to me if
  9017	we find where they haul out—”
  9018	
  9019	“It seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused,” I laughed.
  9020	
  9021	She flushed quickly and prettily.  “I’ll admit I don’t like defeat any
  9022	more than you do, or any more than I like the idea of killing such
  9023	pretty, inoffensive creatures.”
  9024	
  9025	“Pretty!” I sniffed.  “I failed to mark anything pre-eminently pretty
  9026	about those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me.”
  9027	
  9028	“Your point of view,” she laughed.  “You lacked perspective.  Now if you
  9029	did not have to get so close to the subject—”
  9030	
  9031	“The very thing!” I cried.  “What I need is a longer club.  And there’s
  9032	that broken oar ready to hand.”
  9033	
  9034	“It just comes to me,” she said, “that Captain Larsen was telling me how
  9035	the men raided the rookeries.  They drive the seals, in small herds, a
  9036	short distance inland before they kill them.”
  9037	
  9038	“I don’t care to undertake the herding of one of those harems,” I
  9039	objected.
  9040	
  9041	“But there are the holluschickie,” she said.  “The holluschickie haul out
  9042	by themselves, and Dr. Jordan says that paths are left between the
  9043	harems, and that as long as the holluschickie keep strictly to the path
  9044	they are unmolested by the masters of the harem.”
  9045	
  9046	“There’s one now,” I said, pointing to a young bull in the water.  “Let’s
  9047	watch him, and follow him if he hauls out.”
  9048	
  9049	He swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small opening
  9050	between two harems, the masters of which made warning noises but did not
  9051	attack him.  We watched him travel slowly inward, threading about among
  9052	the harems along what must have been the path.
  9053	
  9054	“Here goes,” I said, stepping out; but I confess my heart was in my mouth
  9055	as I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous herd.
  9056	
  9057	“It would be wise to make the boat fast,” Maud said.
  9058	
  9059	She had stepped out beside me, and I regarded her with wonderment.
  9060	
  9061	She nodded her head determinedly.  “Yes, I’m going with you, so you may
  9062	as well secure the boat and arm me with a club.”
  9063	
  9064	“Let’s go back,” I said dejectedly.  “I think tundra grass, will do,
  9065	after all.”
  9066	
  9067	“You know it won’t,” was her reply.  “Shall I lead?”
  9068	
  9069	With a shrug of the shoulders, but with the warmest admiration and pride
  9070	at heart for this woman, I equipped her with the broken oar and took
  9071	another for myself.  It was with nervous trepidation that we made the
  9072	first few rods of the journey.  Once Maud screamed in terror as a cow
  9073	thrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot, and several times I quickened
  9074	my pace for the same reason.  But, beyond warning coughs from either
  9075	side, there were no signs of hostility.  It was a rookery which had never
  9076	been raided by the hunters, and in consequence the seals were
  9077	mild-tempered and at the same time unafraid.
  9078	
  9079	In the very heart of the herd the din was terrific.  It was almost
  9080	dizzying in its effect.  I paused and smiled reassuringly at Maud, for I
  9081	had recovered my equanimity sooner than she.  I could see that she was
  9082	still badly frightened.  She came close to me and shouted:
  9083	
  9084	“I’m dreadfully afraid!”
  9085	
  9086	And I was not.  Though the novelty had not yet worn off, the peaceful
  9087	comportment of the seals had quieted my alarm.  Maud was trembling.
  9088	
  9089	“I’m afraid, and I’m not afraid,” she chattered with shaking jaws.  “It’s
  9090	my miserable body, not I.”
  9091	
  9092	“It’s all right, it’s all right,” I reassured her, my arm passing
  9093	instinctively and protectingly around her.
  9094	
  9095	I shall never forget, in that moment, how instantly conscious I became of
  9096	my manhood.  The primitive deeps of my nature stirred.  I felt myself
  9097	masculine, the protector of the weak, the fighting male.  And, best of
  9098	all, I felt myself the protector of my loved one.  She leaned against me,
  9099	so light and lily-frail, and as her trembling eased away it seemed as
  9100	though I became aware of prodigious strength.  I felt myself a match for
  9101	the most ferocious bull in the herd, and I know, had such a bull charged
  9102	upon me, that I should have met it unflinchingly and quite coolly, and I
  9103	know that I should have killed it.
  9104	
  9105	“I am all right now,” she said, looking up at me gratefully.  “Let us go
  9106	on.”
  9107	
  9108	And that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence,
  9109	filled me with an exultant joy.  The youth of the race seemed burgeoning
  9110	in me, over-civilized man that I was, and I lived for myself the old
  9111	hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry.  I
  9112	had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought as we went along
  9113	the path between the jostling harems.
  9114	
  9115	A quarter of a mile inland we came upon the holluschickie—sleek young
  9116	bulls, living out the loneliness of their bachelorhood and gathering
  9117	strength against the day when they would fight their way into the ranks
  9118	of the Benedicts.
  9119	
  9120	Everything now went smoothly.  I seemed to know just what to do and how
  9121	to do it.  Shouting, making threatening gestures with my club, and even
  9122	prodding the lazy ones, I quickly cut out a score of the young bachelors
  9123	from their companions.  Whenever one made an attempt to break back toward
  9124	the water, I headed it off.  Maud took an active part in the drive, and
  9125	with her cries and flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable
  9126	assistance.  I noticed, though, that whenever one looked tired and
  9127	lagged, she let it slip past.  But I noticed, also, whenever one, with a
  9128	show of fight, tried to break past, that her eyes glinted and showed
  9129	bright, and she rapped it smartly with her club.
  9130	
  9131	“My, it’s exciting!” she cried, pausing from sheer weakness.  “I think
  9132	I’ll sit down.”
  9133	
  9134	I drove the little herd (a dozen strong, now, what of the escapes she had
  9135	permitted) a hundred yards farther on; and by the time she joined me I
  9136	had finished the slaughter and was beginning to skin.  An hour later we
  9137	went proudly back along the path between the harems.  And twice again we
  9138	came down the path burdened with skins, till I thought we had enough to
  9139	roof the hut.  I set the sail, laid one tack out of the cove, and on the
  9140	other tack made our own little inner cove.
  9141	
  9142	“It’s just like home-coming,” Maud said, as I ran the boat ashore.
  9143	
  9144	I heard her words with a responsive thrill, it was all so dearly intimate
  9145	and natural, and I said:
  9146	
  9147	“It seems as though I have lived this life always.  The world of books
  9148	and bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream memory than an
  9149	actuality.  I surely have hunted and forayed and fought all the days of
  9150	my life.  And you, too, seem a part of it.  You are—”  I was on the verge
  9151	of saying, “my woman, my mate,” but glibly changed it to—“standing the
  9152	hardship well.”
  9153	
  9154	But her ear had caught the flaw.  She recognized a flight that midmost
  9155	broke.  She gave me a quick look.
  9156	
  9157	“Not that.  You were saying—?”
  9158	
  9159	“That the American Mrs. Meynell was living the life of a savage and
  9160	living it quite successfully,” I said easily.
  9161	
  9162	“Oh,” was all she replied; but I could have sworn there was a note of
  9163	disappointment in her voice.
  9164	
  9165	But “my woman, my mate” kept ringing in my head for the rest of the day
  9166	and for many days.  Yet never did it ring more loudly than that night, as
  9167	I watched her draw back the blanket of moss from the coals, blow up the
  9168	fire, and cook the evening meal.  It must have been latent savagery
  9169	stirring in me, for the old words, so bound up with the roots of the
  9170	race, to grip me and thrill me.  And grip and thrill they did, till I
  9171	fell asleep, murmuring them to myself over and over again.
  9172	
  9173	
  9174	
  9175	
  9176	CHAPTER XXXI
  9177	
  9178	
  9179	“It will smell,” I said, “but it will keep in the heat and keep out the
  9180	rain and snow.”
  9181	
  9182	We were surveying the completed seal-skin roof.
  9183	
  9184	“It is clumsy, but it will serve the purpose, and that is the main
  9185	thing,” I went on, yearning for her praise.
  9186	
  9187	And she clapped her hands and declared that she was hugely pleased.
  9188	
  9189	“But it is dark in here,” she said the next moment, her shoulders
  9190	shrinking with a little involuntary shiver.
  9191	
  9192	“You might have suggested a window when the walls were going up,” I said.
  9193	“It was for you, and you should have seen the need of a window.”
  9194	
  9195	“But I never do see the obvious, you know,” she laughed back.  “And
  9196	besides, you can knock a hole in the wall at any time.”
  9197	
  9198	“Quite true; I had not thought of it,” I replied, wagging my head sagely.
  9199	“But have you thought of ordering the window-glass?  Just call up the
  9200	firm,—Red, 4451, I think it is,—and tell them what size and kind of glass
  9201	you wish.”
  9202	
  9203	“That means—” she began.
  9204	
  9205	“No window.”
  9206	
  9207	It was a dark and evil-appearing thing, that hut, not fit for aught
  9208	better than swine in a civilized land; but for us, who had known the
  9209	misery of the open boat, it was a snug little habitation.  Following the
  9210	housewarming, which was accomplished by means of seal-oil and a wick made
  9211	from cotton calking, came the hunting for our winter’s meat and the
  9212	building of the second hut.  It was a simple affair, now, to go forth in
  9213	the morning and return by noon with a boatload of seals.  And then, while
  9214	I worked at building the hut, Maud tried out the oil from the blubber and
  9215	kept a slow fire under the frames of meat.  I had heard of jerking beef
  9216	on the plains, and our seal-meat, cut in thin strips and hung in the
  9217	smoke, cured excellently.
  9218	
  9219	The second hut was easier to erect, for I built it against the first, and
  9220	only three walls were required.  But it was work, hard work, all of it.
  9221	Maud and I worked from dawn till dark, to the limit of our strength, so
  9222	that when night came we crawled stiffly to bed and slept the animal-like
  9223	sleep of exhaustion.  And yet Maud declared that she had never felt better
  9224	or stronger in her life.  I knew this was true of myself, but hers was
  9225	such a lily strength that I feared she would break down.  Often and
  9226	often, her last-reserve force gone, I have seen her stretched flat on her
  9227	back on the sand in the way she had of resting and recuperating.  And
  9228	then she would be up on her feet and toiling hard as ever.  Where she
  9229	obtained this strength was the marvel to me.
  9230	
  9231	“Think of the long rest this winter,” was her reply to my remonstrances.
  9232	“Why, we’ll be clamorous for something to do.”
  9233	
  9234	We held a housewarming in my hut the night it was roofed.  It was the end
  9235	of the third day of a fierce storm which had swung around the compass
  9236	from the south-east to the north-west, and which was then blowing
  9237	directly in upon us.  The beaches of the outer cove were thundering with
  9238	the surf, and even in our land-locked inner cove a respectable sea was
  9239	breaking.  No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind, and it
  9240	whistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the
  9241	strength of the walls.  The skin roof, stretched tightly as a drumhead, I
  9242	had thought, sagged and bellied with every gust; and innumerable
  9243	interstices in the walls, not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had
  9244	supposed, disclosed themselves.  Yet the seal-oil burned brightly and we
  9245	were warm and comfortable.
  9246	
  9247	It was a pleasant evening indeed, and we voted that as a social function
  9248	on Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed.  Our minds were at
  9249	ease.  Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter winter, but we
  9250	were prepared for it.  The seals could depart on their mysterious journey
  9251	into the south at any time, now, for all we cared; and the storms held no
  9252	terror for us.  Not only were we sure of being dry and warm and sheltered
  9253	from the wind, but we had the softest and most luxurious mattresses that
  9254	could be made from moss.  This had been Maud’s idea, and she had herself
  9255	jealously gathered all the moss.  This was to be my first night on the
  9256	mattress, and I knew I should sleep the sweeter because she had made it.
  9257	
  9258	As she rose to go she turned to me with the whimsical way she had, and
  9259	said:
  9260	
  9261	“Something is going to happen—is happening, for that matter.  I feel it.
  9262	Something is coming here, to us.  It is coming now.  I don’t know what,
  9263	but it is coming.”
  9264	
  9265	“Good or bad?” I asked.
  9266	
  9267	She shook her head.  “I don’t know, but it is there, somewhere.”
  9268	
  9269	She pointed in the direction of the sea and wind.
  9270	
  9271	“It’s a lee shore,” I laughed, “and I am sure I’d rather be here than
  9272	arriving, a night like this.”
  9273	
  9274	“You are not frightened?” I asked, as I stepped to open the door for her.
  9275	
  9276	Her eyes looked bravely into mine.
  9277	
  9278	“And you feel well? perfectly well?”
  9279	
  9280	“Never better,” was her answer.
  9281	
  9282	We talked a little longer before she went.
  9283	
  9284	“Good-night, Maud,” I said.
  9285	
  9286	“Good-night, Humphrey,” she said.
  9287	
  9288	This use of our given names had come about quite as a matter of course,
  9289	and was as unpremeditated as it was natural.  In that moment I could have
  9290	put my arms around her and drawn her to me.  I should certainly have done
  9291	so out in that world to which we belonged.  As it was, the situation
  9292	stopped there in the only way it could; but I was left alone in my little
  9293	hut, glowing warmly through and through with a pleasant satisfaction; and
  9294	I knew that a tie, or a tacit something, existed between us which had not
  9295	existed before.
  9296	
  9297	
  9298	
  9299	
  9300	CHAPTER XXXII
  9301	
  9302	
  9303	I awoke, oppressed by a mysterious sensation.  There seemed something
  9304	missing in my environment.  But the mystery and oppressiveness vanished
  9305	after the first few seconds of waking, when I identified the missing
  9306	something as the wind.  I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve
  9307	tension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement,
  9308	and I had awakened, still tense, bracing myself to meet the pressure of
  9309	something which no longer bore upon me.
  9310	
  9311	It was the first night I had spent under cover in several months, and I
  9312	lay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets (for once not wet with
  9313	fog or spray), analysing, first, the effect produced upon me by the
  9314	cessation of the wind, and next, the joy which was mine from resting on
  9315	the mattress made by Maud’s hands.  When I had dressed and opened the
  9316	door, I heard the waves still lapping on the beach, garrulously attesting
  9317	the fury of the night.  It was a clear day, and the sun was shining.  I
  9318	had slept late, and I stepped outside with sudden energy, bent upon
  9319	making up lost time as befitted a dweller on Endeavour Island.
  9320	
  9321	And when outside, I stopped short.  I believed my eyes without question,
  9322	and yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed to me.
  9323	There, on the beach, not fifty feet away, bow on, dismasted, was a
  9324	black-hulled vessel.  Masts and booms, tangled with shrouds, sheets, and
  9325	rent canvas, were rubbing gently alongside.  I could have rubbed my eyes
  9326	as I looked.  There was the home-made galley we had built, the familiar
  9327	break of the poop, the low yacht-cabin scarcely rising above the rail.
  9328	It was the _Ghost_.
  9329	
  9330	What freak of fortune had brought it here—here of all spots? what chance
  9331	of chances?  I looked at the bleak, inaccessible wall at my back and know
  9332	the profundity of despair.  Escape was hopeless, out of the question.  I
  9333	thought of Maud, asleep there in the hut we had reared; I remembered her
  9334	“Good-night, Humphrey”; “my woman, my mate,” went ringing through my
  9335	brain, but now, alas, it was a knell that sounded.  Then everything went
  9336	black before my eyes.
  9337	
  9338	Possibly it was the fraction of a second, but I had no knowledge of how
  9339	long an interval had lapsed before I was myself again.  There lay the
  9340	_Ghost_, bow on to the beach, her splintered bowsprit projecting over the
  9341	sand, her tangled spars rubbing against her side to the lift of the
  9342	crooning waves.  Something must be done, must be done.
  9343	
  9344	It came upon me suddenly, as strange, that nothing moved aboard.  Wearied
  9345	from the night of struggle and wreck, all hands were yet asleep, I
  9346	thought.  My next thought was that Maud and I might yet escape.  If we
  9347	could take to the boat and make round the point before any one awoke?  I
  9348	would call her and start.  My hand was lifted at her door to knock, when
  9349	I recollected the smallness of the island.  We could never hide ourselves
  9350	upon it.  There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean.  I thought of
  9351	our snug little huts, our supplies of meat and oil and moss and firewood,
  9352	and I knew that we could never survive the wintry sea and the great
  9353	storms which were to come.
  9354	
  9355	So I stood, with hesitant knuckle, without her door.  It was impossible,
  9356	impossible.  A wild thought of rushing in and killing her as she slept
  9357	rose in my mind.  And then, in a flash, the better solution came to me.
  9358	All hands were asleep.  Why not creep aboard the _Ghost_,—well I knew the
  9359	way to Wolf Larsen’s bunk,—and kill him in his sleep?  After that—well,
  9360	we would see.  But with him dead there was time and space in which to
  9361	prepare to do other things; and besides, whatever new situation arose, it
  9362	could not possibly be worse than the present one.
  9363	
  9364	My knife was at my hip.  I returned to my hut for the shot-gun, made sure
  9365	it was loaded, and went down to the _Ghost_.  With some difficulty, and
  9366	at the expense of a wetting to the waist, I climbed aboard.  The
  9367	forecastle scuttle was open.  I paused to listen for the breathing of the
  9368	men, but there was no breathing.  I almost gasped as the thought came to
  9369	me: What if the _Ghost_ is deserted?  I listened more closely.  There was
  9370	no sound.  I cautiously descended the ladder.  The place had the empty
  9371	and musty feel and smell usual to a dwelling no longer inhabited.
  9372	Everywhere was a thick litter of discarded and ragged garments, old
  9373	sea-boots, leaky oilskins—all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long
  9374	voyage.
  9375	
  9376	Abandoned hastily, was my conclusion, as I ascended to the deck.  Hope
  9377	was alive again in my breast, and I looked about me with greater
  9378	coolness.  I noted that the boats were missing.  The steerage told the
  9379	same tale as the forecastle.  The hunters had packed their belongings
  9380	with similar haste.  The _Ghost_ was deserted.  It was Maud’s and mine.
  9381	I thought of the ship’s stores and the lazarette beneath the cabin, and
  9382	the idea came to me of surprising Maud with something nice for breakfast.
  9383	
  9384	The reaction from my fear, and the knowledge that the terrible deed I had
  9385	come to do was no longer necessary, made me boyish and eager.  I went up
  9386	the steerage companion-way two steps at a time, with nothing distinct in
  9387	my mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the
  9388	surprise breakfast was quite ready for her.  As I rounded the galley, a
  9389	new satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils
  9390	inside.  I sprang up the break of the poop, and saw—Wolf Larsen.  What of
  9391	my impetus and the stunning surprise, I clattered three or four steps
  9392	along the deck before I could stop myself.  He was standing in the
  9393	companion-way, only his head and shoulders visible, staring straight at
  9394	me.  His arms were resting on the half-open slide.  He made no movement
  9395	whatever—simply stood there, staring at me.
  9396	
  9397	I began to tremble.  The old stomach sickness clutched me.  I put one
  9398	hand on the edge of the house to steady myself.  My lips seemed suddenly
  9399	dry and I moistened them against the need of speech.  Nor did I for an
  9400	instant take my eyes off him.  Neither of us spoke.  There was something
  9401	ominous in his silence, his immobility.  All my old fear of him returned
  9402	and by my new fear was increased an hundred-fold.  And still we stood, the
  9403	pair of us, staring at each other.
  9404	
  9405	I was aware of the demand for action, and, my old helplessness strong
  9406	upon me, I was waiting for him to take the initiative.  Then, as the
  9407	moments went by, it came to me that the situation was analogous to the
  9408	one in which I had approached the long-maned bull, my intention of
  9409	clubbing obscured by fear until it became a desire to make him run.  So
  9410	it was at last impressed upon me that I was there, not to have Wolf
  9411	Larsen take the initiative, but to take it myself.
  9412	
  9413	I cocked both barrels and levelled the shot-gun at him.  Had he moved,
  9414	attempted to drop down the companion-way, I know I would have shot him.
  9415	But he stood motionless and staring as before.  And as I faced him, with
  9416	levelled gun shaking in my hands, I had time to note the worn and haggard
  9417	appearance of his face.  It was as if some strong anxiety had wasted it.
  9418	The cheeks were sunken, and there was a wearied, puckered expression on
  9419	the brow.  And it seemed to me that his eyes were strange, not only the
  9420	expression, but the physical seeming, as though the optic nerves and
  9421	supporting muscles had suffered strain and slightly twisted the eyeballs.
  9422	
  9423	All this I saw, and my brain now working rapidly, I thought a thousand
  9424	thoughts; and yet I could not pull the triggers.  I lowered the gun and
  9425	stepped to the corner of the cabin, primarily to relieve the tension on
  9426	my nerves and to make a new start, and incidentally to be closer.  Again
  9427	I raised the gun.  He was almost at arm’s length.  There was no hope for
  9428	him.  I was resolved.  There was no possible chance of missing him, no
  9429	matter how poor my marksmanship.  And yet I wrestled with myself and
  9430	could not pull the triggers.
  9431	
  9432	“Well?” he demanded impatiently.
  9433	
  9434	I strove vainly to force my fingers down on the triggers, and vainly I
  9435	strove to say something.
  9436	
  9437	“Why don’t you shoot?” he asked.
  9438	
  9439	I cleared my throat of a huskiness which prevented speech.  “Hump,” he
  9440	said slowly, “you can’t do it.  You are not exactly afraid.  You are
  9441	impotent.  Your conventional morality is stronger than you.  You are the
  9442	slave to the opinions which have credence among the people you have known
  9443	and have read about.  Their code has been drummed into your head from the
  9444	time you lisped, and in spite of your philosophy, and of what I have
  9445	taught you, it won’t let you kill an unarmed, unresisting man.”
  9446	
  9447	“I know it,” I said hoarsely.
  9448	
  9449	“And you know that I would kill an unarmed man as readily as I would
  9450	smoke a cigar,” he went on.  “You know me for what I am,—my worth in the
  9451	world by your standard.  You have called me snake, tiger, shark, monster,
  9452	and Caliban.  And yet, you little rag puppet, you little echoing
  9453	mechanism, you are unable to kill me as you would a snake or a shark,
  9454	because I have hands, feet, and a body shaped somewhat like yours.  Bah!
  9455	I had hoped better things of you, Hump.”
  9456	
  9457	He stepped out of the companion-way and came up to me.
  9458	
  9459	“Put down that gun.  I want to ask you some questions.  I haven’t had a
  9460	chance to look around yet.  What place is this?  How is the _Ghost_
  9461	lying?  How did you get wet?  Where’s Maud?—I beg your pardon, Miss
  9462	Brewster—or should I say, ‘Mrs. Van Weyden’?”
  9463	
  9464	I had backed away from him, almost weeping at my inability to shoot him,
  9465	but not fool enough to put down the gun.  I hoped, desperately, that he
  9466	might commit some hostile act, attempt to strike me or choke me; for in
  9467	such way only I knew I could be stirred to shoot.
  9468	
  9469	“This is Endeavour Island,” I said.
  9470	
  9471	“Never heard of it,” he broke in.
  9472	
  9473	“At least, that’s our name for it,” I amended.
  9474	
  9475	“Our?” he queried.  “Who’s our?”
  9476	
  9477	“Miss Brewster and myself.  And the _Ghost_ is lying, as you can see for
  9478	yourself, bow on to the beach.”
  9479	
  9480	“There are seals here,” he said.  “They woke me up with their barking, or
  9481	I’d be sleeping yet.  I heard them when I drove in last night.  They were
  9482	the first warning that I was on a lee shore.  It’s a rookery, the kind of
  9483	a thing I’ve hunted for years.  Thanks to my brother Death, I’ve lighted
  9484	on a fortune.  It’s a mint.  What’s its bearings?”
  9485	
  9486	“Haven’t the least idea,” I said.  “But you ought to know quite closely.
  9487	What were your last observations?”
  9488	
  9489	He smiled inscrutably, but did not answer.
  9490	
  9491	“Well, where’s all hands?” I asked.  “How does it come that you are
  9492	alone?”
  9493	
  9494	I was prepared for him again to set aside my question, and was surprised
  9495	at the readiness of his reply.
  9496	
  9497	“My brother got me inside forty-eight hours, and through no fault of
  9498	mine.  Boarded me in the night with only the watch on deck.  Hunters went
  9499	back on me.  He gave them a bigger lay.  Heard him offering it.  Did it
  9500	right before me.  Of course the crew gave me the go-by.  That was to be
  9501	expected.  All hands went over the side, and there I was, marooned on my
  9502	own vessel.  It was Death’s turn, and it’s all in the family anyway.”
  9503	
  9504	“But how did you lose the masts?” I asked.
  9505	
  9506	“Walk over and examine those lanyards,” he said, pointing to where the
  9507	mizzen-rigging should have been.
  9508	
  9509	“They have been cut with a knife!” I exclaimed.
  9510	
  9511	“Not quite,” he laughed.  “It was a neater job.  Look again.”
  9512	
  9513	I looked.  The lanyards had been almost severed, with just enough left to
  9514	hold the shrouds till some severe strain should be put upon them.
  9515	
  9516	“Cooky did that,” he laughed again.  “I know, though I didn’t spot him at
  9517	it.  Kind of evened up the score a bit.”
  9518	
  9519	“Good for Mugridge!” I cried.
  9520	
  9521	“Yes, that’s what I thought when everything went over the side.  Only I
  9522	said it on the other side of my mouth.”
  9523	
  9524	“But what were you doing while all this was going on?” I asked.
  9525	
  9526	“My best, you may be sure, which wasn’t much under the circumstances.”
  9527	
  9528	I turned to re-examine Thomas Mugridge’s work.
  9529	
  9530	“I guess I’ll sit down and take the sunshine,” I heard Wolf Larsen
  9531	saying.
  9532	
  9533	There was a hint, just a slight hint, of physical feebleness in his
  9534	voice, and it was so strange that I looked quickly at him.  His hand was
  9535	sweeping nervously across his face, as though he were brushing away
  9536	cobwebs.  I was puzzled.  The whole thing was so unlike the Wolf Larsen I
  9537	had known.
  9538	
  9539	“How are your headaches?” I asked.
  9540	
  9541	“They still trouble me,” was his answer.  “I think I have one coming on
  9542	now.”
  9543	
  9544	He slipped down from his sitting posture till he lay on the deck.  Then
  9545	he rolled over on his side, his head resting on the biceps of the under
  9546	arm, the forearm shielding his eyes from the sun.  I stood regarding him
  9547	wonderingly.
  9548	
  9549	“Now’s your chance, Hump,” he said.
  9550	
  9551	“I don’t understand,” I lied, for I thoroughly understood.
  9552	
  9553	“Oh, nothing,” he added softly, as if he were drowsing; “only you’ve got
  9554	me where you want me.”
  9555	
  9556	“No, I haven’t,” I retorted; “for I want you a few thousand miles away
  9557	from here.”
  9558	
  9559	He chuckled, and thereafter spoke no more.  He did not stir as I passed
  9560	by him and went down into the cabin.  I lifted the trap in the floor, but
  9561	for some moments gazed dubiously into the darkness of the lazarette
  9562	beneath.  I hesitated to descend.  What if his lying down were a ruse?
  9563	Pretty, indeed, to be caught there like a rat.  I crept softly up the
  9564	companion-way and peeped at him.  He was lying as I had left him.  Again
  9565	I went below; but before I dropped into the lazarette I took the
  9566	precaution of casting down the door in advance.  At least there would be
  9567	no lid to the trap.  But it was all needless.  I regained the cabin with
  9568	a store of jams, sea-biscuits, canned meats, and such things,—all I could
  9569	carry,—and replaced the trap-door.
  9570	
  9571	A peep at Wolf Larsen showed me that he had not moved.  A bright thought
  9572	struck me.  I stole into his state-room and possessed myself of his
  9573	revolvers.  There were no other weapons, though I thoroughly ransacked
  9574	the three remaining state-rooms.  To make sure, I returned and went
  9575	through the steerage and forecastle, and in the galley gathered up all
  9576	the sharp meat and vegetable knives.  Then I bethought me of the great
  9577	yachtsman’s knife he always carried, and I came to him and spoke to him,
  9578	first softly, then loudly.  He did not move.  I bent over and took it
  9579	from his pocket.  I breathed more freely.  He had no arms with which to
  9580	attack me from a distance; while I, armed, could always forestall him
  9581	should he attempt to grapple me with his terrible gorilla arms.
  9582	
  9583	Filling a coffee-pot and frying-pan with part of my plunder, and taking
  9584	some chinaware from the cabin pantry, I left Wolf Larsen lying in the sun
  9585	and went ashore.
  9586	
  9587	Maud was still asleep.  I blew up the embers (we had not yet arranged a
  9588	winter kitchen), and quite feverishly cooked the breakfast.  Toward the
  9589	end, I heard her moving about within the hut, making her toilet.  Just as
  9590	all was ready and the coffee poured, the door opened and she came forth.
  9591	
  9592	“It’s not fair of you,” was her greeting.  “You are usurping one of my
  9593	prerogatives.  You know you I agreed that the cooking should be mine,
  9594	and—”
  9595	
  9596	“But just this once,” I pleaded.
  9597	
  9598	“If you promise not to do it again,” she smiled.  “Unless, of course, you
  9599	have grown tired of my poor efforts.”
  9600	
  9601	To my delight she never once looked toward the beach, and I maintained
  9602	the banter with such success all unconsciously she sipped coffee from the
  9603	china cup, ate fried evaporated potatoes, and spread marmalade on her
  9604	biscuit.  But it could not last.  I saw the surprise that came over her.
  9605	She had discovered the china plate from which she was eating.  She looked
  9606	over the breakfast, noting detail after detail.  Then she looked at me,
  9607	and her face turned slowly toward the beach.
  9608	
  9609	“Humphrey!” she said.
  9610	
  9611	The old unnamable terror mounted into her eyes.
  9612	
  9613	“Is—he?” she quavered.
  9614	
  9615	I nodded my head.
  9616	
  9617	
  9618	
  9619	
  9620	CHAPTER XXXIIII
  9621	
  9622	
  9623	We waited all day for Wolf Larsen to come ashore.  It was an intolerable
  9624	period of anxiety.  Each moment one or the other of us cast expectant
  9625	glances toward the _Ghost_.  But he did not come.  He did not even appear
  9626	on deck.
  9627	
  9628	“Perhaps it is his headache,” I said.  “I left him lying on the poop.  He
  9629	may lie there all night.  I think I’ll go and see.”
  9630	
  9631	Maud looked entreaty at me.
  9632	
  9633	“It is all right,” I assured her.  “I shall take the revolvers.  You know
  9634	I collected every weapon on board.”
  9635	
  9636	“But there are his arms, his hands, his terrible, terrible hands!” she
  9637	objected.  And then she cried, “Oh, Humphrey, I am afraid of him!  Don’t
  9638	go—please don’t go!”
  9639	
  9640	She rested her hand appealingly on mine, and sent my pulse fluttering.
  9641	My heart was surely in my eyes for a moment.  The dear and lovely woman!
  9642	And she was so much the woman, clinging and appealing, sunshine and dew
  9643	to my manhood, rooting it deeper and sending through it the sap of a new
  9644	strength.  I was for putting my arm around her, as when in the midst of
  9645	the seal herd; but I considered, and refrained.
  9646	
  9647	“I shall not take any risks,” I said.  “I’ll merely peep over the bow and
  9648	see.”
  9649	
  9650	She pressed my hand earnestly and let me go.  But the space on deck where
  9651	I had left him lying was vacant.  He had evidently gone below.  That
  9652	night we stood alternate watches, one of us sleeping at a time; for there
  9653	was no telling what Wolf Larsen might do.  He was certainly capable of
  9654	anything.
  9655	
  9656	The next day we waited, and the next, and still he made no sign.
  9657	
  9658	“These headaches of his, these attacks,” Maud said, on the afternoon of
  9659	the fourth day; “Perhaps he is ill, very ill.  He may be dead.”
  9660	
  9661	“Or dying,” was her afterthought when she had waited some time for me to
  9662	speak.
  9663	
  9664	“Better so,” I answered.
  9665	
  9666	“But think, Humphrey, a fellow-creature in his last lonely hour.”
  9667	
  9668	“Perhaps,” I suggested.
  9669	
  9670	“Yes, even perhaps,” she acknowledged.  “But we do not know.  It would be
  9671	terrible if he were.  I could never forgive myself.  We must do
  9672	something.”
  9673	
  9674	“Perhaps,” I suggested again.
  9675	
  9676	I waited, smiling inwardly at the woman of her which compelled a
  9677	solicitude for Wolf Larsen, of all creatures.  Where was her solicitude
  9678	for me, I thought,—for me whom she had been afraid to have merely peep
  9679	aboard?
  9680	
  9681	She was too subtle not to follow the trend of my silence.  And she was as
  9682	direct as she was subtle.
  9683	
  9684	“You must go aboard, Humphrey, and find out,” she said.  “And if you want
  9685	to laugh at me, you have my consent and forgiveness.”
  9686	
  9687	I arose obediently and went down the beach.
  9688	
  9689	“Do be careful,” she called after me.
  9690	
  9691	I waved my arm from the forecastle head and dropped down to the deck.
  9692	Aft I walked to the cabin companion, where I contented myself with
  9693	hailing below.  Wolf Larsen answered, and as he started to ascend the
  9694	stairs I cocked my revolver.  I displayed it openly during our
  9695	conversation, but he took no notice of it.  He appeared the same,
  9696	physically, as when last I saw him, but he was gloomy and silent.  In
  9697	fact, the few words we spoke could hardly be called a conversation.  I
  9698	did not inquire why he had not been ashore, nor did he ask why I had not
  9699	come aboard.  His head was all right again, he said, and so, without
  9700	further parley, I left him.
  9701	
  9702	Maud received my report with obvious relief, and the sight of smoke which
  9703	later rose in the galley put her in a more cheerful mood.  The next day,
  9704	and the next, we saw the galley smoke rising, and sometimes we caught
  9705	glimpses of him on the poop.  But that was all.  He made no attempt to
  9706	come ashore.  This we knew, for we still maintained our night-watches.
  9707	We were waiting for him to do something, to show his hand, so to say, and
  9708	his inaction puzzled and worried us.
  9709	
  9710	A week of this passed by.  We had no other interest than Wolf Larsen, and
  9711	his presence weighed us down with an apprehension which prevented us from
  9712	doing any of the little things we had planned.
  9713	
  9714	But at the end of the week the smoke ceased rising from the galley, and
  9715	he no longer showed himself on the poop.  I could see Maud’s solicitude
  9716	again growing, though she timidly—and even proudly, I think—forbore a
  9717	repetition of her request.  After all, what censure could be put upon
  9718	her?  She was divinely altruistic, and she was a woman.  Besides, I was
  9719	myself aware of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill,
  9720	dying alone with his fellow-creatures so near.  He was right.  The code
  9721	of my group was stronger than I.  The fact that he had hands, feet, and a
  9722	body shaped somewhat like mine, constituted a claim which I could not
  9723	ignore.
  9724	
  9725	So I did not wait a second time for Maud to send me.  I discovered that
  9726	we stood in need of condensed milk and marmalade, and announced that I
  9727	was going aboard.  I could see that she wavered.  She even went so far as
  9728	to murmur that they were non-essentials and that my trip after them might
  9729	be inexpedient.  And as she had followed the trend of my silence, she now
  9730	followed the trend of my speech, and she knew that I was going aboard,
  9731	not because of condensed milk and marmalade, but because of her and of
  9732	her anxiety, which she knew she had failed to hide.
  9733	
  9734	I took off my shoes when I gained the forecastle head, and went
  9735	noiselessly aft in my stocking feet.  Nor did I call this time from the
  9736	top of the companion-way.  Cautiously descending, I found the cabin
  9737	deserted.  The door to his state-room was closed.  At first I thought of
  9738	knocking, then I remembered my ostensible errand and resolved to carry it
  9739	out.  Carefully avoiding noise, I lifted the trap-door in the floor and
  9740	set it to one side.  The slop-chest, as well as the provisions, was
  9741	stored in the lazarette, and I took advantage of the opportunity to lay
  9742	in a stock of underclothing.
  9743	
  9744	As I emerged from the lazarette I heard sounds in Wolf Larsen’s
  9745	state-room.  I crouched and listened.  The door-knob rattled.  Furtively,
  9746	instinctively, I slunk back behind the table and drew and cocked my
  9747	revolver.  The door swung open and he came forth.  Never had I seen so
  9748	profound a despair as that which I saw on his face,—the face of Wolf
  9749	Larsen the fighter, the strong man, the indomitable one.  For all the
  9750	world like a woman wringing her hands, he raised his clenched fists and
  9751	groaned.  One fist unclosed, and the open palm swept across his eyes as
  9752	though brushing away cobwebs.
  9753	
  9754	“God!  God!” he groaned, and the clenched fists were raised again to the
  9755	infinite despair with which his throat vibrated.
  9756	
  9757	It was horrible.  I was trembling all over, and I could feel the shivers
  9758	running up and down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead.
  9759	Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of
  9760	a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.
  9761	
  9762	But Wolf Larsen regained control of himself by an exertion of his
  9763	remarkable will.  And it was exertion.  His whole frame shook with the
  9764	struggle.  He resembled a man on the verge of a fit.  His face strove to
  9765	compose itself, writhing and twisting in the effort till he broke down
  9766	again.  Once more the clenched fists went upward and he groaned.  He
  9767	caught his breath once or twice and sobbed.  Then he was successful.  I
  9768	could have thought him the old Wolf Larsen, and yet there was in his
  9769	movements a vague suggestion of weakness and indecision.  He started for
  9770	the companion-way, and stepped forward quite as I had been accustomed to
  9771	see him do; and yet again, in his very walk, there seemed that suggestion
  9772	of weakness and indecision.
  9773	
  9774	I was now concerned with fear for myself.  The open trap lay directly in
  9775	his path, and his discovery of it would lead instantly to his discovery
  9776	of me.  I was angry with myself for being caught in so cowardly a
  9777	position, crouching on the floor.  There was yet time.  I rose swiftly to
  9778	my feet, and, I know, quite unconsciously assumed a defiant attitude.  He
  9779	took no notice of me.  Nor did he notice the open trap.  Before I could
  9780	grasp the situation, or act, he had walked right into the trap.  One foot
  9781	was descending into the opening, while the other foot was just on the
  9782	verge of beginning the uplift.  But when the descending foot missed the
  9783	solid flooring and felt vacancy beneath, it was the old Wolf Larsen and
  9784	the tiger muscles that made the falling body spring across the opening,
  9785	even as it fell, so that he struck on his chest and stomach, with arms
  9786	outstretched, on the floor of the opposite side.  The next instant he had
  9787	drawn up his legs and rolled clear.  But he rolled into my marmalade and
  9788	underclothes and against the trap-door.
  9789	
  9790	The expression on his face was one of complete comprehension.  But before
  9791	I could guess what he had comprehended, he had dropped the trap-door into
  9792	place, closing the lazarette.  Then I understood.  He thought he had me
  9793	inside.  Also, he was blind, blind as a bat.  I watched him, breathing
  9794	carefully so that he should not hear me.  He stepped quickly to his
  9795	state-room.  I saw his hand miss the door-knob by an inch, quickly fumble
  9796	for it, and find it.  This was my chance.  I tiptoed across the cabin and
  9797	to the top of the stairs.  He came back, dragging a heavy sea-chest,
  9798	which he deposited on top of the trap.  Not content with this he fetched
  9799	a second chest and placed it on top of the first.  Then he gathered up
  9800	the marmalade and underclothes and put them on the table.  When he
  9801	started up the companion-way, I retreated, silently rolling over on top
  9802	of the cabin.
  9803	
  9804	He shoved the slide part way back and rested his arms on it, his body
  9805	still in the companion-way.  His attitude was of one looking forward the
  9806	length of the schooner, or staring, rather, for his eyes were fixed and
  9807	unblinking.  I was only five feet away and directly in what should have
  9808	been his line of vision.  It was uncanny.  I felt myself a ghost, what of
  9809	my invisibility.  I waved my hand back and forth, of course without
  9810	effect; but when the moving shadow fell across his face I saw at once
  9811	that he was susceptible to the impression.  His face became more
  9812	expectant and tense as he tried to analyze and identify the impression.
  9813	He knew that he had responded to something from without, that his
  9814	sensibility had been touched by a changing something in his environment;
  9815	but what it was he could not discover.  I ceased waving my hand, so that
  9816	the shadow remained stationary.  He slowly moved his head back and forth
  9817	under it and turned from side to side, now in the sunshine, now in the
  9818	shade, feeling the shadow, as it were, testing it by sensation.
  9819	
  9820	I, too, was busy, trying to reason out how he was aware of the existence
  9821	of so intangible a thing as a shadow.  If it were his eyeballs only that
  9822	were affected, or if his optic nerve were not wholly destroyed, the
  9823	explanation was simple.  If otherwise, then the only conclusion I could
  9824	reach was that the sensitive skin recognized the difference of
  9825	temperature between shade and sunshine.  Or, perhaps,—who can tell?—it
  9826	was that fabled sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an
  9827	object close at hand.
  9828	
  9829	Giving over his attempt to determine the shadow, he stepped on deck and
  9830	started forward, walking with a swiftness and confidence which surprised
  9831	me.  And still there was that hint of the feebleness of the blind in his
  9832	walk.  I knew it now for what it was.
  9833	
  9834	To my amused chagrin, he discovered my shoes on the forecastle head and
  9835	brought them back with him into the galley.  I watched him build the fire
  9836	and set about cooking food for himself; then I stole into the cabin for
  9837	my marmalade and underclothes, slipped back past the galley, and climbed
  9838	down to the beach to deliver my barefoot report.
  9839	
  9840	
  9841	
  9842	
  9843	CHAPTER XXXIV
  9844	
  9845	
  9846	“It’s too bad the _Ghost_ has lost her masts.  Why we could sail away in
  9847	her.  Don’t you think we could, Humphrey?”
  9848	
  9849	I sprang excitedly to my feet.
  9850	
  9851	“I wonder, I wonder,” I repeated, pacing up and down.
  9852	
  9853	Maud’s eyes were shining with anticipation as they followed me.  She had
  9854	such faith in me!  And the thought of it was so much added power.  I
  9855	remembered Michelet’s “To man, woman is as the earth was to her legendary
  9856	son; he has but to fall down and kiss her breast and he is strong again.”
  9857	For the first time I knew the wonderful truth of his words.  Why, I was
  9858	living them.  Maud was all this to me, an unfailing, source of strength
  9859	and courage.  I had but to look at her, or think of her, and be strong
  9860	again.
  9861	
  9862	“It can be done, it can be done,” I was thinking and asserting aloud.
  9863	“What men have done, I can do; and if they have never done this before,
  9864	still I can do it.”
  9865	
  9866	“What? for goodness’ sake,” Maud demanded.  “Do be merciful.  What is it
  9867	you can do?”
  9868	
  9869	“We can do it,” I amended.  “Why, nothing else than put the masts back
  9870	into the _Ghost_ and sail away.”
  9871	
  9872	“Humphrey!” she exclaimed.
  9873	
  9874	And I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already a fact
  9875	accomplished.
  9876	
  9877	“But how is it possible to be done?” she asked.
  9878	
  9879	“I don’t know,” was my answer.  “I know only that I am capable of doing
  9880	anything these days.”
  9881	
  9882	I smiled proudly at her—too proudly, for she dropped her eyes and was for
  9883	the moment silent.
  9884	
  9885	“But there is Captain Larsen,” she objected.
  9886	
  9887	“Blind and helpless,” I answered promptly, waving him aside as a straw.
  9888	
  9889	“But those terrible hands of his!  You know how he leaped across the
  9890	opening of the lazarette.”
  9891	
  9892	“And you know also how I crept about and avoided him,” I contended gaily.
  9893	
  9894	“And lost your shoes.”
  9895	
  9896	“You’d hardly expect them to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet inside of
  9897	them.”
  9898	
  9899	We both laughed, and then went seriously to work constructing the plan
  9900	whereby we were to step the masts of the _Ghost_ and return to the world.
  9901	I remembered hazily the physics of my school days, while the last few
  9902	months had given me practical experience with mechanical purchases.  I
  9903	must say, though, when we walked down to the _Ghost_ to inspect more
  9904	closely the task before us, that the sight of the great masts lying in
  9905	the water almost disheartened me.  Where were we to begin?  If there had
  9906	been one mast standing, something high up to which to fasten blocks and
  9907	tackles!  But there was nothing.  It reminded me of the problem of
  9908	lifting oneself by one’s boot-straps.  I understood the mechanics of
  9909	levers; but where was I to get a fulcrum?
  9910	
  9911	There was the mainmast, fifteen inches in diameter at what was now the
  9912	butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly
  9913	calculated, at least three thousand pounds.  And then came the foremast,
  9914	larger in diameter, and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds.
  9915	Where was I to begin?  Maud stood silently by my side, while I evolved in
  9916	my mind the contrivance known among sailors as “shears.”  But, though
  9917	known to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavour Island.  By crossing
  9918	and lashing the ends of two spars, and then elevating them in the air
  9919	like an inverted “V,” I could get a point above the deck to which to make
  9920	fast my hoisting tackle.  To this hoisting tackle I could, if necessary,
  9921	attach a second hoisting tackle.  And then there was the windlass!
  9922	
  9923	Maud saw that I had achieved a solution, and her eyes warmed
  9924	sympathetically.
  9925	
  9926	“What are you going to do?” she asked.
  9927	
  9928	“Clear that raffle,” I answered, pointing to the tangled wreckage
  9929	overside.
  9930	
  9931	Ah, the decisiveness, the very sound of the words, was good in my ears.
  9932	“Clear that raffle!”  Imagine so salty a phrase on the lips of the
  9933	Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone!
  9934	
  9935	There must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose and voice,
  9936	for Maud smiled.  Her appreciation of the ridiculous was keen, and in all
  9937	things she unerringly saw and felt, where it existed, the touch of sham,
  9938	the overshading, the overtone.  It was this which had given poise and
  9939	penetration to her own work and made her of worth to the world.  The
  9940	serious critic, with the sense of humour and the power of expression,
  9941	must inevitably command the world’s ear.  And so it was that she had
  9942	commanded.  Her sense of humour was really the artist’s instinct for
  9943	proportion.
  9944	
  9945	“I’m sure I’ve heard it before, somewhere, in books,” she murmured
  9946	gleefully.
  9947	
  9948	I had an instinct for proportion myself, and I collapsed forthwith,
  9949	descending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state of
  9950	humble confusion which was, to say the least, very miserable.
  9951	
  9952	Her hand leapt out at once to mine.
  9953	
  9954	“I’m so sorry,” she said.
  9955	
  9956	“No need to be,” I gulped.  “It does me good.  There’s too much of the
  9957	schoolboy in me.  All of which is neither here nor there.  What we’ve got
  9958	to do is actually and literally to clear that raffle.  If you’ll come
  9959	with me in the boat, we’ll get to work and straighten things out.”
  9960	
  9961	“‘When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their
  9962	teeth,’” she quoted at me; and for the rest of the afternoon we made
  9963	merry over our labour.
  9964	
  9965	Her task was to hold the boat in position while I worked at the tangle.
  9966	And such a tangle—halyards, sheets, guys, down-hauls, shrouds, stays, all
  9967	washed about and back and forth and through, and twined and knotted by
  9968	the sea.  I cut no more than was necessary, and what with passing the
  9969	long ropes under and around the booms and masts, of unreeving the
  9970	halyards and sheets, of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order
  9971	to pass through another knot in the bight, I was soon wet to the skin.
  9972	
  9973	The sails did require some cutting, and the canvas, heavy with water,
  9974	tried my strength severely; but I succeeded before nightfall in getting
  9975	it all spread out on the beach to dry.  We were both very tired when we
  9976	knocked off for supper, and we had done good work, too, though to the eye
  9977	it appeared insignificant.
  9978	
  9979	Next morning, with Maud as able assistant, I went into the hold of the
  9980	_Ghost_ to clear the steps of the mast-butts.  We had no more than begun
  9981	work when the sound of my knocking and hammering brought Wolf Larsen.
  9982	
  9983	“Hello below!” he cried down the open hatch.
  9984	
  9985	The sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me, as for
  9986	protection, and she rested one hand on my arm while we parleyed.
  9987	
  9988	“Hello on deck,” I replied.  “Good-morning to you.”
  9989	
  9990	“What are you doing down there?” he demanded.  “Trying to scuttle my ship
  9991	for me?”
  9992	
  9993	“Quite the opposite; I’m repairing her,” was my answer.
  9994	
  9995	“But what in thunder are you repairing?”  There was puzzlement in his
  9996	voice.
  9997	
  9998	“Why, I’m getting everything ready for re-stepping the masts,” I replied
  9999	easily, as though it were the simplest project imaginable.
 10000	
 10001	“It seems as though you’re standing on your own legs at last, Hump,” we
 10002	heard him say; and then for some time he was silent.
 10003	
 10004	“But I say, Hump,” he called down.  “You can’t do it.”
 10005	
 10006	“Oh, yes, I can,” I retorted.  “I’m doing it now.”
 10007	
 10008	“But this is my vessel, my particular property.  What if I forbid you?”
 10009	
 10010	“You forget,” I replied.  “You are no longer the biggest bit of the
 10011	ferment.  You were, once, and able to eat me, as you were pleased to
 10012	phrase it; but there has been a diminishing, and I am now able to eat
 10013	you.  The yeast has grown stale.”
 10014	
 10015	He gave a short, disagreeable laugh.  “I see you’re working my philosophy
 10016	back on me for all it is worth.  But don’t make the mistake of
 10017	under-estimating me.  For your own good I warn you.”
 10018	
 10019	“Since when have you become a philanthropist?” I queried.  “Confess, now,
 10020	in warning me for my own good, that you are very consistent.”
 10021	
 10022	He ignored my sarcasm, saying, “Suppose I clap the hatch on, now?  You
 10023	won’t fool me as you did in the lazarette.”
 10024	
 10025	“Wolf Larsen,” I said sternly, for the first time addressing him by this
 10026	his most familiar name, “I am unable to shoot a helpless, unresisting
 10027	man.  You have proved that to my satisfaction as well as yours.  But I
 10028	warn you now, and not so much for your own good as for mine, that I shall
 10029	shoot you the moment you attempt a hostile act.  I can shoot you now, as
 10030	I stand here; and if you are so minded, just go ahead and try to clap on
 10031	the hatch.”
 10032	
 10033	“Nevertheless, I forbid you, I distinctly forbid your tampering with my
 10034	ship.”
 10035	
 10036	“But, man!” I expostulated, “you advance the fact that it is your ship as
 10037	though it were a moral right.  You have never considered moral rights in
 10038	your dealings with others.  You surely do not dream that I’ll consider
 10039	them in dealing with you?”
 10040	
 10041	I had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could see him.  The
 10042	lack of expression on his face, so different from when I had watched him
 10043	unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes.  It was not a
 10044	pleasant face to look upon.
 10045	
 10046	“And none so poor, not even Hump, to do him reverence,” he sneered.
 10047	
 10048	The sneer was wholly in his voice.  His face remained expressionless as
 10049	ever.
 10050	
 10051	“How do you do, Miss Brewster,” he said suddenly, after a pause.
 10052	
 10053	I started.  She had made no noise whatever, had not even moved.  Could it
 10054	be that some glimmer of vision remained to him? or that his vision was
 10055	coming back?
 10056	
 10057	“How do you do, Captain Larsen,” she answered.  “Pray, how did you know I
 10058	was here?”
 10059	
 10060	“Heard you breathing, of course.  I say, Hump’s improving, don’t you
 10061	think so?”
 10062	
 10063	“I don’t know,” she answered, smiling at me.  “I have never seen him
 10064	otherwise.”
 10065	
 10066	“You should have seen him before, then.”
 10067	
 10068	“Wolf Larsen, in large doses,” I murmured, “before and after taking.”
 10069	
 10070	“I want to tell you again, Hump,” he said threateningly, “that you’d
 10071	better leave things alone.”
 10072	
 10073	“But don’t you care to escape as well as we?” I asked incredulously.
 10074	
 10075	“No,” was his answer.  “I intend dying here.”
 10076	
 10077	“Well, we don’t,” I concluded defiantly, beginning again my knocking and
 10078	hammering.
 10079	
 10080	
 10081	
 10082	
 10083	CHAPTER XXXV
 10084	
 10085	
 10086	Next day, the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness, we started to
 10087	get the two topmasts aboard.  The maintopmast was over thirty feet in
 10088	length, the foretopmast nearly thirty, and it was of these that I
 10089	intended making the shears.  It was puzzling work.  Fastening one end of
 10090	a heavy tackle to the windlass, and with the other end fast to the butt
 10091	of the foretopmast, I began to heave.  Maud held the turn on the windlass
 10092	and coiled down the slack.
 10093	
 10094	We were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted.  It was an
 10095	improved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was enormous.  Of
 10096	course, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; as many times
 10097	as it doubled my strength, that many times was doubled the length of rope
 10098	I heaved in.  The tackle dragged heavily across the rail, increasing its
 10099	drag as the spar arose more and more out of the water, and the exertion
 10100	on the windlass grew severe.
 10101	
 10102	But when the butt of the topmast was level with the rail, everything came
 10103	to a standstill.
 10104	
 10105	“I might have known it,” I said impatiently.  “Now we have to do it all
 10106	over again.”
 10107	
 10108	“Why not fasten the tackle part way down the mast?” Maud suggested.
 10109	
 10110	“It’s what I should have done at first,” I answered, hugely disgusted
 10111	with myself.
 10112	
 10113	Slipping off a turn, I lowered the mast back into the water and fastened
 10114	the tackle a third of the way down from the butt.  In an hour, what of
 10115	this and of rests between the heaving, I had hoisted it to the point
 10116	where I could hoist no more.  Eight feet of the butt was above the rail,
 10117	and I was as far away as ever from getting the spar on board.  I sat down
 10118	and pondered the problem.  It did not take long.  I sprang jubilantly to
 10119	my feet.
 10120	
 10121	“Now I have it!” I cried.  “I ought to make the tackle fast at the point
 10122	of balance.  And what we learn of this will serve us with everything else
 10123	we have to hoist aboard.”
 10124	
 10125	Once again I undid all my work by lowering the mast into the water.  But
 10126	I miscalculated the point of balance, so that when I heaved the top of
 10127	the mast came up instead of the butt.  Maud looked despair, but I laughed
 10128	and said it would do just as well.
 10129	
 10130	Instructing her how to hold the turn and be ready to slack away at
 10131	command, I laid hold of the mast with my hands and tried to balance it
 10132	inboard across the rail.  When I thought I had it I cried to her to slack
 10133	away; but the spar righted, despite my efforts, and dropped back toward
 10134	the water.  Again I heaved it up to its old position, for I had now
 10135	another idea.  I remembered the watch-tackle—a small double and single
 10136	block affair—and fetched it.
 10137	
 10138	While I was rigging it between the top of the spar and the opposite rail,
 10139	Wolf Larsen came on the scene.  We exchanged nothing more than
 10140	good-mornings, and, though he could not see, he sat on the rail out of
 10141	the way and followed by the sound all that I did.
 10142	
 10143	Again instructing Maud to slack away at the windlass when I gave the
 10144	word, I proceeded to heave on the watch-tackle.  Slowly the mast swung in
 10145	until it balanced at right angles across the rail; and then I discovered
 10146	to my amazement that there was no need for Maud to slack away.  In fact,
 10147	the very opposite was necessary.  Making the watch-tackle fast, I hove on
 10148	the windlass and brought in the mast, inch by inch, till its top tilted
 10149	down to the deck and finally its whole length lay on the deck.
 10150	
 10151	I looked at my watch.  It was twelve o’clock.  My back was aching sorely,
 10152	and I felt extremely tired and hungry.  And there on the deck was a
 10153	single stick of timber to show for a whole morning’s work.  For the first
 10154	time I thoroughly realized the extent of the task before us.  But I was
 10155	learning, I was learning.  The afternoon would show far more
 10156	accomplished.  And it did; for we returned at one o’clock, rested and
 10157	strengthened by a hearty dinner.
 10158	
 10159	In less than an hour I had the maintopmast on deck and was constructing
 10160	the shears.  Lashing the two topmasts together, and making allowance for
 10161	their unequal length, at the point of intersection I attached the double
 10162	block of the main throat-halyards.  This, with the single block and the
 10163	throat-halyards themselves, gave me a hoisting tackle.  To prevent the
 10164	butts of the masts from slipping on the deck, I nailed down thick cleats.
 10165	Everything in readiness, I made a line fast to the apex of the shears and
 10166	carried it directly to the windlass.  I was growing to have faith in that
 10167	windlass, for it gave me power beyond all expectation.  As usual, Maud
 10168	held the turn while I heaved.  The shears rose in the air.
 10169	
 10170	Then I discovered I had forgotten guy-ropes.  This necessitated my
 10171	climbing the shears, which I did twice, before I finished guying it fore
 10172	and aft and to either side.  Twilight had set in by the time this was
 10173	accomplished.  Wolf Larsen, who had sat about and listened all afternoon
 10174	and never opened his mouth, had taken himself off to the galley and
 10175	started his supper.  I felt quite stiff across the small of the back, so
 10176	much so that I straightened up with an effort and with pain.  I looked
 10177	proudly at my work.  It was beginning to show.  I was wild with desire,
 10178	like a child with a new toy, to hoist something with my shears.
 10179	
 10180	“I wish it weren’t so late,” I said.  “I’d like to see how it works.”
 10181	
 10182	“Don’t be a glutton, Humphrey,” Maud chided me.  “Remember, to-morrow is
 10183	coming, and you’re so tired now that you can hardly stand.”
 10184	
 10185	“And you?” I said, with sudden solicitude.  “You must be very tired.  You
 10186	have worked hard and nobly.  I am proud of you, Maud.”
 10187	
 10188	“Not half so proud as I am of you, nor with half the reason,” she
 10189	answered, looking me straight in the eyes for a moment with an expression
 10190	in her own and a dancing, tremulous light which I had not seen before and
 10191	which gave me a pang of quick delight, I know not why, for I did not
 10192	understand it.  Then she dropped her eyes, to lift them again, laughing.
 10193	
 10194	“If our friends could see us now,” she said.  “Look at us.  Have you ever
 10195	paused for a moment to consider our appearance?”
 10196	
 10197	“Yes, I have considered yours, frequently,” I answered, puzzling over
 10198	what I had seen in her eyes and puzzled by her sudden change of subject.
 10199	
 10200	“Mercy!” she cried.  “And what do I look like, pray?”
 10201	
 10202	“A scarecrow, I’m afraid,” I replied.  “Just glance at your draggled
 10203	skirts, for instance.  Look at those three-cornered tears.  And such a
 10204	waist!  It would not require a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that you have
 10205	been cooking over a camp-fire, to say nothing of trying out seal-blubber.
 10206	And to cap it all, that cap!  And all that is the woman who wrote ‘A Kiss
 10207	Endured.’”
 10208	
 10209	She made me an elaborate and stately courtesy, and said, “As for you,
 10210	sir—”
 10211	
 10212	And yet, through the five minutes of banter which followed, there was a
 10213	serious something underneath the fun which I could not but relate to the
 10214	strange and fleeting expression I had caught in her eyes.  What was it?
 10215	Could it be that our eyes were speaking beyond the will of our speech?
 10216	My eyes had spoken, I knew, until I had found the culprits out and
 10217	silenced them.  This had occurred several times.  But had she seen the
 10218	clamour in them and understood?  And had her eyes so spoken to me?  What
 10219	else could that expression have meant—that dancing, tremulous light, and
 10220	a something more which words could not describe.  And yet it could not
 10221	be.  It was impossible.  Besides, I was not skilled in the speech of
 10222	eyes.  I was only Humphrey Van Weyden, a bookish fellow who loved.  And
 10223	to love, and to wait and win love, that surely was glorious enough for
 10224	me.  And thus I thought, even as we chaffed each other’s appearance,
 10225	until we arrived ashore and there were other things to think about.
 10226	
 10227	“It’s a shame, after working hard all day, that we cannot have an
 10228	uninterrupted night’s sleep,” I complained, after supper.
 10229	
 10230	“But there can be no danger now? from a blind man?” she queried.
 10231	
 10232	“I shall never be able to trust him,” I averred, “and far less now that
 10233	he is blind.  The liability is that his part helplessness will make him
 10234	more malignant than ever.  I know what I shall do to-morrow, the first
 10235	thing—run out a light anchor and kedge the schooner off the beach.  And
 10236	each night when we come ashore in the boat, Mr. Wolf Larsen will be left
 10237	a prisoner on board.  So this will be the last night we have to stand
 10238	watch, and because of that it will go the easier.”
 10239	
 10240	We were awake early and just finishing breakfast as daylight came.
 10241	
 10242	“Oh, Humphrey!” I heard Maud cry in dismay and suddenly stop.
 10243	
 10244	I looked at her.  She was gazing at the _Ghost_.  I followed her gaze,
 10245	but could see nothing unusual.  She looked at me, and I looked inquiry
 10246	back.
 10247	
 10248	“The shears,” she said, and her voice trembled.
 10249	
 10250	I had forgotten their existence.  I looked again, but could not see them.
 10251	
 10252	“If he has—” I muttered savagely.
 10253	
 10254	She put her hand sympathetically on mine, and said, “You will have to
 10255	begin over again.”
 10256	
 10257	“Oh, believe me, my anger means nothing; I could not hurt a fly,” I
 10258	smiled back bitterly.  “And the worst of it is, he knows it.  You are
 10259	right.  If he has destroyed the shears, I shall do nothing except begin
 10260	over again.”
 10261	
 10262	“But I’ll stand my watch on board hereafter,” I blurted out a moment
 10263	later.  “And if he interferes—”
 10264	
 10265	“But I dare not stay ashore all night alone,” Maud was saying when I came
 10266	back to myself.  “It would be so much nicer if he would be friendly with
 10267	us and help us.  We could all live comfortably aboard.”
 10268	
 10269	“We will,” I asserted, still savagely, for the destruction of my beloved
 10270	shears had hit me hard.  “That is, you and I will live aboard, friendly
 10271	or not with Wolf Larsen.”
 10272	
 10273	“It’s childish,” I laughed later, “for him to do such things, and for me
 10274	to grow angry over them, for that matter.”
 10275	
 10276	But my heart smote me when we climbed aboard and looked at the havoc he
 10277	had done.  The shears were gone altogether.  The guys had been slashed
 10278	right and left.  The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across
 10279	through every part.  And he knew I could not splice.  A thought struck
 10280	me.  I ran to the windlass.  It would not work.  He had broken it.  We
 10281	looked at each other in consternation.  Then I ran to the side.  The
 10282	masts, booms, and gaffs I had cleared were gone.  He had found the lines
 10283	which held them, and cast them adrift.
 10284	
 10285	Tears were in Maud’s eyes, and I do believe they were for me.  I could
 10286	have wept myself.  Where now was our project of remasting the _Ghost_?
 10287	He had done his work well.  I sat down on the hatch-combing and rested my
 10288	chin on my hands in black despair.
 10289	
 10290	“He deserves to die,” I cried out; “and God forgive me, I am not man
 10291	enough to be his executioner.”
 10292	
 10293	But Maud was by my side, passing her hand soothingly through my hair as
 10294	though I were a child, and saying, “There, there; it will all come right.
 10295	We are in the right, and it must come right.”
 10296	
 10297	I remembered Michelet and leaned my head against her; and truly I became
 10298	strong again.  The blessed woman was an unfailing fount of power to me.
 10299	What did it matter?  Only a set-back, a delay.  The tide could not have
 10300	carried the masts far to seaward, and there had been no wind.  It meant
 10301	merely more work to find them and tow them back.  And besides, it was a
 10302	lesson.  I knew what to expect.  He might have waited and destroyed our
 10303	work more effectually when we had more accomplished.
 10304	
 10305	“Here he comes now,” she whispered.
 10306	
 10307	I glanced up.  He was strolling leisurely along the poop on the port
 10308	side.
 10309	
 10310	“Take no notice of him,” I whispered.  “He’s coming to see how we take
 10311	it.  Don’t let him know that we know.  We can deny him that satisfaction.
 10312	Take off your shoes—that’s right—and carry them in your hand.”
 10313	
 10314	And then we played hide-and-seek with the blind man.  As he came up the
 10315	port side we slipped past on the starboard; and from the poop we watched
 10316	him turn and start aft on our track.
 10317	
 10318	He must have known, somehow, that we were on board, for he said
 10319	“Good-morning” very confidently, and waited, for the greeting to be
 10320	returned.  Then he strolled aft, and we slipped forward.
 10321	
 10322	“Oh, I know you’re aboard,” he called out, and I could see him listen
 10323	intently after he had spoken.
 10324	
 10325	It reminded me of the great hoot-owl, listening, after its booming cry,
 10326	for the stir of its frightened prey.  But we did not stir, and we moved
 10327	only when he moved.  And so we dodged about the deck, hand in hand, like
 10328	a couple of children chased by a wicked ogre, till Wolf Larsen, evidently
 10329	in disgust, left the deck for the cabin.  There was glee in our eyes, and
 10330	suppressed titters in our mouths, as we put on our shoes and clambered
 10331	over the side into the boat.  And as I looked into Maud’s clear brown
 10332	eyes I forgot the evil he had done, and I knew only that I loved her, and
 10333	that because of her the strength was mine to win our way back to the
 10334	world.
 10335	
 10336	
 10337	
 10338	
 10339	CHAPTER XXXVI
 10340	
 10341	
 10342	For two days Maud and I ranged the sea and explored the beaches in search
 10343	of the missing masts.  But it was not till the third day that we found
 10344	them, all of them, the shears included, and, of all perilous places, in
 10345	the pounding surf of the grim south-western promontory.  And how we
 10346	worked!  At the dark end of the first day we returned, exhausted, to our
 10347	little cove, towing the mainmast behind us.  And we had been compelled to
 10348	row, in a dead calm, practically every inch of the way.
 10349	
 10350	Another day of heart-breaking and dangerous toil saw us in camp with the
 10351	two topmasts to the good.  The day following I was desperate, and I
 10352	rafted together the foremast, the fore and main booms, and the fore and
 10353	main gaffs.  The wind was favourable, and I had thought to tow them back
 10354	under sail, but the wind baffled, then died away, and our progress with
 10355	the oars was a snail’s pace.  And it was such dispiriting effort.  To
 10356	throw one’s whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat
 10357	checked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind, was not exactly
 10358	exhilarating.
 10359	
 10360	Night began to fall, and to make matters worse, the wind sprang up ahead.
 10361	Not only did all forward motion cease, but we began to drift back and out
 10362	to sea.  I struggled at the oars till I was played out.  Poor Maud, whom
 10363	I could never prevent from working to the limit of her strength, lay
 10364	weakly back in the stern-sheets.  I could row no more.  My bruised and
 10365	swollen hands could no longer close on the oar handles.  My wrists and
 10366	arms ached intolerably, and though I had eaten heartily of a
 10367	twelve-o’clock lunch, I had worked so hard that I was faint from hunger.
 10368	
 10369	I pulled in the oars and bent forward to the line which held the tow.
 10370	But Maud’s hand leaped out restrainingly to mine.
 10371	
 10372	“What are you going to do?” she asked in a strained, tense voice.
 10373	
 10374	“Cast it off,” I answered, slipping a turn of the rope.
 10375	
 10376	But her fingers closed on mine.
 10377	
 10378	“Please don’t,” she begged.
 10379	
 10380	“It is useless,” I answered.  “Here is night and the wind blowing us off
 10381	the land.”
 10382	
 10383	“But think, Humphrey.  If we cannot sail away on the _Ghost_, we may
 10384	remain for years on the island—for life even.  If it has never been
 10385	discovered all these years, it may never be discovered.”
 10386	
 10387	“You forget the boat we found on the beach,” I reminded her.
 10388	
 10389	“It was a seal-hunting boat,” she replied, “and you know perfectly well
 10390	that if the men had escaped they would have been back to make their
 10391	fortunes from the rookery.  You know they never escaped.”
 10392	
 10393	I remained silent, undecided.
 10394	
 10395	“Besides,” she added haltingly, “it’s your idea, and I want to see you
 10396	succeed.”
 10397	
 10398	Now I could harden my heart.  As soon as she put it on a flattering
 10399	personal basis, generosity compelled me to deny her.
 10400	
 10401	“Better years on the island than to die to-night, or to-morrow, or the
 10402	next day, in the open boat.  We are not prepared to brave the sea.  We
 10403	have no food, no water, no blankets, nothing.  Why, you’d not survive the
 10404	night without blankets: I know how strong you are.  You are shivering
 10405	now.”
 10406	
 10407	“It is only nervousness,” she answered.  “I am afraid you will cast off
 10408	the masts in spite of me.”
 10409	
 10410	“Oh, please, please, Humphrey, don’t!” she burst out, a moment later.
 10411	
 10412	And so it ended, with the phrase she knew had all power over me.  We
 10413	shivered miserably throughout the night.  Now and again I fitfully slept,
 10414	but the pain of the cold always aroused me.  How Maud could stand it was
 10415	beyond me.  I was too tired to thrash my arms about and warm myself, but
 10416	I found strength time and again to chafe her hands and feet to restore
 10417	the circulation.  And still she pleaded with me not to cast off the
 10418	masts.  About three in the morning she was caught by a cold cramp, and
 10419	after I had rubbed her out of that she became quite numb.  I was
 10420	frightened.  I got out the oars and made her row, though she was so weak
 10421	I thought she would faint at every stroke.
 10422	
 10423	Morning broke, and we looked long in the growing light for our island.
 10424	At last it showed, small and black, on the horizon, fully fifteen miles
 10425	away.  I scanned the sea with my glasses.  Far away in the south-west I
 10426	could see a dark line on the water, which grew even as I looked at it.
 10427	
 10428	“Fair wind!” I cried in a husky voice I did not recognize as my own.
 10429	
 10430	Maud tried to reply, but could not speak.  Her lips were blue with cold,
 10431	and she was hollow-eyed—but oh, how bravely her brown eyes looked at me!
 10432	How piteously brave!
 10433	
 10434	Again I fell to chafing her hands and to moving her arms up and down and
 10435	about until she could thrash them herself.  Then I compelled her to stand
 10436	up, and though she would have fallen had I not supported her, I forced
 10437	her to walk back and forth the several steps between the thwart and the
 10438	stern-sheets, and finally to spring up and down.
 10439	
 10440	“Oh, you brave, brave woman,” I said, when I saw the life coming back
 10441	into her face.  “Did you know that you were brave?”
 10442	
 10443	“I never used to be,” she answered.  “I was never brave till I knew you.
 10444	It is you who have made me brave.”
 10445	
 10446	“Nor I, until I knew you,” I answered.
 10447	
 10448	She gave me a quick look, and again I caught that dancing, tremulous
 10449	light and something more in her eyes.  But it was only for the moment.
 10450	Then she smiled.
 10451	
 10452	“It must have been the conditions,” she said; but I knew she was wrong,
 10453	and I wondered if she likewise knew.  Then the wind came, fair and fresh,
 10454	and the boat was soon labouring through a heavy sea toward the island.
 10455	At half-past three in the afternoon we passed the south-western
 10456	promontory.  Not only were we hungry, but we were now suffering from
 10457	thirst.  Our lips were dry and cracked, nor could we longer moisten them
 10458	with our tongues.  Then the wind slowly died down.  By night it was dead
 10459	calm and I was toiling once more at the oars—but weakly, most weakly.  At
 10460	two in the morning the boat’s bow touched the beach of our own inner cove
 10461	and I staggered out to make the painter fast.  Maud could not stand, nor
 10462	had I strength to carry her.  I fell in the sand with her, and, when I
 10463	had recovered, contented myself with putting my hands under her shoulders
 10464	and dragging her up the beach to the hut.
 10465	
 10466	The next day we did no work.  In fact, we slept till three in the
 10467	afternoon, or at least I did, for I awoke to find Maud cooking dinner.
 10468	Her power of recuperation was wonderful.  There was something tenacious
 10469	about that lily-frail body of hers, a clutch on existence which one could
 10470	not reconcile with its patent weakness.
 10471	
 10472	“You know I was travelling to Japan for my health,” she said, as we
 10473	lingered at the fire after dinner and delighted in the movelessness of
 10474	loafing.  “I was not very strong.  I never was.  The doctors recommended
 10475	a sea voyage, and I chose the longest.”
 10476	
 10477	“You little knew what you were choosing,” I laughed.
 10478	
 10479	“But I shall be a different women for the experience, as well as a
 10480	stronger woman,” she answered; “and, I hope a better woman.  At least I
 10481	shall understand a great deal more of life.”
 10482	
 10483	Then, as the short day waned, we fell to discussing Wolf Larsen’s
 10484	blindness.  It was inexplicable.  And that it was grave, I instanced his
 10485	statement that he intended to stay and die on Endeavour Island.  When he,
 10486	strong man that he was, loving life as he did, accepted his death, it was
 10487	plain that he was troubled by something more than mere blindness.  There
 10488	had been his terrific headaches, and we were agreed that it was some sort
 10489	of brain break-down, and that in his attacks he endured pain beyond our
 10490	comprehension.
 10491	
 10492	I noticed as we talked over his condition, that Maud’s sympathy went out
 10493	to him more and more; yet I could not but love her for it, so sweetly
 10494	womanly was it.  Besides, there was no false sentiment about her feeling.
 10495	She was agreed that the most rigorous treatment was necessary if we were
 10496	to escape, though she recoiled at the suggestion that I might some time
 10497	be compelled to take his life to save my own—“our own,” she put it.
 10498	
 10499	In the morning we had breakfast and were at work by daylight.  I found a
 10500	light kedge anchor in the fore-hold, where such things were kept; and
 10501	with a deal of exertion got it on deck and into the boat.  With a long
 10502	running-line coiled down in the stem, I rowed well out into our little
 10503	cove and dropped the anchor into the water.  There was no wind, the tide
 10504	was high, and the schooner floated.  Casting off the shore-lines, I
 10505	kedged her out by main strength (the windlass being broken), till she
 10506	rode nearly up and down to the small anchor—too small to hold her in any
 10507	breeze.  So I lowered the big starboard anchor, giving plenty of slack;
 10508	and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass.
 10509	
 10510	Three days I worked on that windlass.  Least of all things was I a
 10511	mechanic, and in that time I accomplished what an ordinary machinist
 10512	would have done in as many hours.  I had to learn my tools to begin with,
 10513	and every simple mechanical principle which such a man would have at his
 10514	finger ends I had likewise to learn.  And at the end of three days I had
 10515	a windlass which worked clumsily.  It never gave the satisfaction the old
 10516	windlass had given, but it worked and made my work possible.
 10517	
 10518	In half a day I got the two topmasts aboard and the shears rigged and
 10519	guyed as before.  And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my
 10520	work.  Maud, who refused to stay alone ashore, slept in the forecastle.
 10521	Wolf Larsen had sat about, listening to my repairing the windlass and
 10522	talking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects.  No reference was
 10523	made on either side to the destruction of the shears; nor did he say
 10524	anything further about my leaving his ship alone.  But still I had feared
 10525	him, blind and helpless and listening, always listening, and I never let
 10526	his strong arms get within reach of me while I worked.
 10527	
 10528	On this night, sleeping under my beloved shears, I was aroused by his
 10529	footsteps on the deck.  It was a starlight night, and I could see the
 10530	bulk of him dimly as he moved about.  I rolled out of my blankets and
 10531	crept noiselessly after him in my stocking feet.  He had armed himself
 10532	with a draw-knife from the tool-locker, and with this he prepared to cut
 10533	across the throat-halyards I had again rigged to the shears.  He felt the
 10534	halyards with his hands and discovered that I had not made them fast.
 10535	This would not do for a draw-knife, so he laid hold of the running part,
 10536	hove taut, and made fast.  Then he prepared to saw across with the
 10537	draw-knife.
 10538	
 10539	“I wouldn’t, if I were you,” I said quietly.
 10540	
 10541	He heard the click of my pistol and laughed.
 10542	
 10543	“Hello, Hump,” he said.  “I knew you were here all the time.  You can’t
 10544	fool my ears.”
 10545	
 10546	“That’s a lie, Wolf Larsen,” I said, just as quietly as before.
 10547	“However, I am aching for a chance to kill you, so go ahead and cut.”
 10548	
 10549	“You have the chance always,” he sneered.
 10550	
 10551	“Go ahead and cut,” I threatened ominously.
 10552	
 10553	“I’d rather disappoint you,” he laughed, and turned on his heel and went
 10554	aft.
 10555	
 10556	“Something must be done, Humphrey,” Maud said, next morning, when I had
 10557	told her of the night’s occurrence.  “If he has liberty, he may do
 10558	anything.  He may sink the vessel, or set fire to it.  There is no
 10559	telling what he may do.  We must make him a prisoner.”
 10560	
 10561	“But how?” I asked, with a helpless shrug.  “I dare not come within reach
 10562	of his arms, and he knows that so long as his resistance is passive I
 10563	cannot shoot him.”
 10564	
 10565	“There must be some way,” she contended.  “Let me think.”
 10566	
 10567	“There is one way,” I said grimly.
 10568	
 10569	She waited.
 10570	
 10571	I picked up a seal-club.
 10572	
 10573	“It won’t kill him,” I said.  “And before he could recover I’d have him
 10574	bound hard and fast.”
 10575	
 10576	She shook her head with a shudder.  “No, not that.  There must be some
 10577	less brutal way.  Let us wait.”
 10578	
 10579	But we did not have to wait long, and the problem solved itself.  In the
 10580	morning, after several trials, I found the point of balance in the
 10581	foremast and attached my hoisting tackle a few feet above it.  Maud held
 10582	the turn on the windlass and coiled down while I heaved.  Had the
 10583	windlass been in order it would not have been so difficult; as it was, I
 10584	was compelled to apply all my weight and strength to every inch of the
 10585	heaving.  I had to rest frequently.  In truth, my spells of resting were
 10586	longer than those of working.  Maud even contrived, at times when all my
 10587	efforts could not budge the windlass, to hold the turn with one hand and
 10588	with the other to throw the weight of her slim body to my assistance.
 10589	
 10590	At the end of an hour the single and double blocks came together at the
 10591	top of the shears.  I could hoist no more.  And yet the mast was not
 10592	swung entirely inboard.  The butt rested against the outside of the port
 10593	rail, while the top of the mast overhung the water far beyond the
 10594	starboard rail.  My shears were too short.  All my work had been for
 10595	nothing.  But I no longer despaired in the old way.  I was acquiring more
 10596	confidence in myself and more confidence in the possibilities of
 10597	windlasses, shears, and hoisting tackles.  There was a way in which it
 10598	could be done, and it remained for me to find that way.
 10599	
 10600	While I was considering the problem, Wolf Larsen came on deck.  We
 10601	noticed something strange about him at once.  The indecisiveness, or
 10602	feebleness, of his movements was more pronounced.  His walk was actually
 10603	tottery as he came down the port side of the cabin.  At the break of the
 10604	poop he reeled, raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing
 10605	gesture, and fell down the steps—still on his feet—to the main deck,
 10606	across which he staggered, falling and flinging out his arms for support.
 10607	He regained his balance by the steerage companion-way and stood there
 10608	dizzily for a space, when he suddenly crumpled up and collapsed, his legs
 10609	bending under him as he sank to the deck.
 10610	
 10611	“One of his attacks,” I whispered to Maud.
 10612	
 10613	She nodded her head; and I could see sympathy warm in eyes.
 10614	
 10615	We went up to him, but he seemed unconscious, breathing spasmodically.
 10616	She took charge of him, lifting his head to keep the blood out of it and
 10617	despatching me to the cabin for a pillow.  I also brought blankets, and
 10618	we made him comfortable.  I took his pulse.  It beat steadily and strong,
 10619	and was quite normal.  This puzzled me.  I became suspicious.
 10620	
 10621	“What if he should be feigning this?” I asked, still holding his wrist.
 10622	
 10623	Maud shook her head, and there was reproof in her eyes.  But just then
 10624	the wrist I held leaped from my hand, and the hand clasped like a steel
 10625	trap about my wrist.  I cried aloud in awful fear, a wild inarticulate
 10626	cry; and I caught one glimpse of his face, malignant and triumphant, as
 10627	his other hand compassed my body and I was drawn down to him in a
 10628	terrible grip.
 10629	
 10630	My wrist was released, but his other arm, passed around my back, held
 10631	both my arms so that I could not move.  His free hand went to my throat,
 10632	and in that moment I knew the bitterest foretaste of death earned by
 10633	one’s own idiocy.  Why had I trusted myself within reach of those
 10634	terrible arms?  I could feel other hands at my throat.  They were Maud’s
 10635	hands, striving vainly to tear loose the hand that was throttling me.
 10636	She gave it up, and I heard her scream in a way that cut me to the soul,
 10637	for it was a woman’s scream of fear and heart-breaking despair.  I had
 10638	heard it before, during the sinking of the _Martinez_.
 10639	
 10640	My face was against his chest and I could not see, but I heard Maud turn
 10641	and run swiftly away along the deck.  Everything was happening quickly.
 10642	I had not yet had a glimmering of unconsciousness, and it seemed that an
 10643	interminable period of time was lapsing before I heard her feet flying
 10644	back.  And just then I felt the whole man sink under me.  The breath was
 10645	leaving his lungs and his chest was collapsing under my weight.  Whether
 10646	it was merely the expelled breath, or his consciousness of his growing
 10647	impotence, I know not, but his throat vibrated with a deep groan.  The
 10648	hand at my throat relaxed.  I breathed.  It fluttered and tightened
 10649	again.  But even his tremendous will could not overcome the dissolution
 10650	that assailed it.  That will of his was breaking down.  He was fainting.
 10651	
 10652	Maud’s footsteps were very near as his hand fluttered for the last time
 10653	and my throat was released.  I rolled off and over to the deck on my
 10654	back, gasping and blinking in the sunshine.  Maud was pale but
 10655	composed,—my eyes had gone instantly to her face,—and she was looking at
 10656	me with mingled alarm and relief.  A heavy seal-club in her hand caught
 10657	my eyes, and at that moment she followed my gaze down to it.  The club
 10658	dropped from her hand as though it had suddenly stung her, and at the
 10659	same moment my heart surged with a great joy.  Truly she was my woman, my
 10660	mate-woman, fighting with me and for me as the mate of a caveman would
 10661	have fought, all the primitive in her aroused, forgetful of her culture,
 10662	hard under the softening civilization of the only life she had ever
 10663	known.
 10664	
 10665	“Dear woman!” I cried, scrambling to my feet.
 10666	
 10667	The next moment she was in my arms, weeping convulsively on my shoulder
 10668	while I clasped her close.  I looked down at the brown glory of her hair,
 10669	glinting gems in the sunshine far more precious to me than those in the
 10670	treasure-chests of kings.  And I bent my head and kissed her hair softly,
 10671	so softly that she did not know.
 10672	
 10673	Then sober thought came to me.  After all, she was only a woman, crying
 10674	her relief, now that the danger was past, in the arms of her protector or
 10675	of the one who had been endangered.  Had I been father or brother, the
 10676	situation would have been in nowise different.  Besides, time and place
 10677	were not meet, and I wished to earn a better right to declare my love.
 10678	So once again I softly kissed her hair as I felt her receding from my
 10679	clasp.
 10680	
 10681	“It was a real attack this time,” I said: “another shock like the one
 10682	that made him blind.  He feigned at first, and in doing so brought it
 10683	on.”
 10684	
 10685	Maud was already rearranging his pillow.
 10686	
 10687	“No,” I said, “not yet.  Now that I have him helpless, helpless he shall
 10688	remain.  From this day we live in the cabin.  Wolf Larsen shall live in
 10689	the steerage.”
 10690	
 10691	I caught him under the shoulders and dragged him to the companion-way.
 10692	At my direction Maud fetched a rope.  Placing this under his shoulders, I
 10693	balanced him across the threshold and lowered him down the steps to the
 10694	floor.  I could not lift him directly into a bunk, but with Maud’s help I
 10695	lifted first his shoulders and head, then his body, balanced him across
 10696	the edge, and rolled him into a lower bunk.
 10697	
 10698	But this was not to be all.  I recollected the handcuffs in his
 10699	state-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient
 10700	and clumsy ship irons.  So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and
 10701	foot.  For the first time in many days I breathed freely.  I felt
 10702	strangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off
 10703	my shoulders.  I felt, also, that Maud and I had drawn more closely
 10704	together.  And I wondered if she, too, felt it, as we walked along the
 10705	deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.
 10706	
 10707	
 10708	
 10709	
 10710	CHAPTER XXXVII
 10711	
 10712	
 10713	At once we moved aboard the _Ghost_, occupying our old state-rooms and
 10714	cooking in the galley.  The imprisonment of Wolf Larsen had happened most
 10715	opportunely, for what must have been the Indian summer of this high
 10716	latitude was gone and drizzling stormy weather had set in.  We were very
 10717	comfortable, and the inadequate shears, with the foremast suspended from
 10718	them, gave a business-like air to the schooner and a promise of
 10719	departure.
 10720	
 10721	And now that we had Wolf Larsen in irons, how little did we need it!
 10722	Like his first attack, his second had been accompanied by serious
 10723	disablement.  Maud made the discovery in the afternoon while trying to
 10724	give him nourishment.  He had shown signs of consciousness, and she had
 10725	spoken to him, eliciting no response.  He was lying on his left side at
 10726	the time, and in evident pain.  With a restless movement he rolled his
 10727	head around, clearing his left ear from the pillow against which it had
 10728	been pressed.  At once he heard and answered her, and at once she came to
 10729	me.
 10730	
 10731	Pressing the pillow against his left ear, I asked him if he heard me, but
 10732	he gave no sign.  Removing the pillow and, repeating the question he
 10733	answered promptly that he did.
 10734	
 10735	“Do you know you are deaf in the right ear?” I asked.
 10736	
 10737	“Yes,” he answered in a low, strong voice, “and worse than that.  My
 10738	whole right side is affected.  It seems asleep.  I cannot move arm or
 10739	leg.”
 10740	
 10741	“Feigning again?” I demanded angrily.
 10742	
 10743	He shook his head, his stern mouth shaping the strangest, twisted smile.
 10744	It was indeed a twisted smile, for it was on the left side only, the
 10745	facial muscles of the right side moving not at all.
 10746	
 10747	“That was the last play of the Wolf,” he said.  “I am paralysed.  I shall
 10748	never walk again.  Oh, only on the other side,” he added, as though
 10749	divining the suspicious glance I flung at his left leg, the knee of which
 10750	had just then drawn up, and elevated the blankets.
 10751	
 10752	“It’s unfortunate,” he continued.  “I’d liked to have done for you first,
 10753	Hump.  And I thought I had that much left in me.”
 10754	
 10755	“But why?” I asked; partly in horror, partly out of curiosity.
 10756	
 10757	Again his stern mouth framed the twisted smile, as he said:
 10758	
 10759	“Oh, just to be alive, to be living and doing, to be the biggest bit of
 10760	the ferment to the end, to eat you.  But to die this way.”
 10761	
 10762	He shrugged his shoulders, or attempted to shrug them, rather, for the
 10763	left shoulder alone moved.  Like the smile, the shrug was twisted.
 10764	
 10765	“But how can you account for it?” I asked.  “Where is the seat of your
 10766	trouble?”
 10767	
 10768	“The brain,” he said at once.  “It was those cursed headaches brought it
 10769	on.”
 10770	
 10771	“Symptoms,” I said.
 10772	
 10773	He nodded his head.  “There is no accounting for it.  I was never sick in
 10774	my life.  Something’s gone wrong with my brain.  A cancer, a tumour, or
 10775	something of that nature,—a thing that devours and destroys.  It’s
 10776	attacking my nerve-centres, eating them up, bit by bit, cell by cell—from
 10777	the pain.”
 10778	
 10779	“The motor-centres, too,” I suggested.
 10780	
 10781	“So it would seem; and the curse of it is that I must lie here,
 10782	conscious, mentally unimpaired, knowing that the lines are going down,
 10783	breaking bit by bit communication with the world.  I cannot see, hearing
 10784	and feeling are leaving me, at this rate I shall soon cease to speak; yet
 10785	all the time I shall be here, alive, active, and powerless.”
 10786	
 10787	“When you say _you_ are here, I’d suggest the likelihood of the soul,” I
 10788	said.
 10789	
 10790	“Bosh!” was his retort.  “It simply means that in the attack on my brain
 10791	the higher psychical centres are untouched.  I can remember, I can think
 10792	and reason.  When that goes, I go.  I am not.  The soul?”
 10793	
 10794	He broke out in mocking laughter, then turned his left ear to the pillow
 10795	as a sign that he wished no further conversation.
 10796	
 10797	Maud and I went about our work oppressed by the fearful fate which had
 10798	overtaken him,—how fearful we were yet fully to realize.  There was the
 10799	awfulness of retribution about it.  Our thoughts were deep and solemn,
 10800	and we spoke to each other scarcely above whispers.
 10801	
 10802	“You might remove the handcuffs,” he said that night, as we stood in
 10803	consultation over him.  “It’s dead safe.  I’m a paralytic now.  The next
 10804	thing to watch out for is bed sores.”
 10805	
 10806	He smiled his twisted smile, and Maud, her eyes wide with horror, was
 10807	compelled to turn away her head.
 10808	
 10809	“Do you know that your smile is crooked?” I asked him; for I knew that
 10810	she must attend him, and I wished to save her as much as possible.
 10811	
 10812	“Then I shall smile no more,” he said calmly.  “I thought something was
 10813	wrong.  My right cheek has been numb all day.  Yes, and I’ve had warnings
 10814	of this for the last three days; by spells, my right side seemed going to
 10815	sleep, sometimes arm or hand, sometimes leg or foot.”
 10816	
 10817	“So my smile is crooked?” he queried a short while after.  “Well,
 10818	consider henceforth that I smile internally, with my soul, if you please,
 10819	my soul.  Consider that I am smiling now.”
 10820	
 10821	And for the space of several minutes he lay there, quiet, indulging his
 10822	grotesque fancy.
 10823	
 10824	The man of him was not changed.  It was the old, indomitable, terrible
 10825	Wolf Larsen, imprisoned somewhere within that flesh which had once been
 10826	so invincible and splendid.  Now it bound him with insentient fetters,
 10827	walling his soul in darkness and silence, blocking it from the world
 10828	which to him had been a riot of action.  No more would he conjugate the
 10829	verb “to do in every mood and tense.”  “To be” was all that remained to
 10830	him—to be, as he had defined death, without movement; to will, but not to
 10831	execute; to think and reason and in the spirit of him to be as alive as
 10832	ever, but in the flesh to be dead, quite dead.
 10833	
 10834	And yet, though I even removed the handcuffs, we could not adjust
 10835	ourselves to his condition.  Our minds revolted.  To us he was full of
 10836	potentiality.  We knew not what to expect of him next, what fearful
 10837	thing, rising above the flesh, he might break out and do.  Our experience
 10838	warranted this state of mind, and we went about our work with anxiety
 10839	always upon us.
 10840	
 10841	I had solved the problem which had arisen through the shortness of the
 10842	shears.  By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new one), I heaved
 10843	the butt of the foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck.
 10844	Next, by means of the shears, I hoisted the main boom on board.  Its
 10845	forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing
 10846	the mast.  By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I
 10847	swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt
 10848	to the deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around it.
 10849	The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached to the end
 10850	of the boom.  Thus, by carrying this tackle to the windlass, I could
 10851	raise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt always remaining
 10852	stationary, and, by means of guys, I could swing the boom from side to
 10853	side.  To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle;
 10854	and when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled
 10855	by the power and latitude it gave me.
 10856	
 10857	Of course, two days’ work was required for the accomplishment of this
 10858	part of my task, and it was not till the morning of the third day that I
 10859	swung the foremast from the deck and proceeded to square its butt to fit
 10860	the step.  Here I was especially awkward.  I sawed and chopped and
 10861	chiselled the weathered wood till it had the appearance of having been
 10862	gnawed by some gigantic mouse.  But it fitted.
 10863	
 10864	“It will work, I know it will work,” I cried.
 10865	
 10866	“Do you know Dr. Jordan’s final test of truth?” Maud asked.
 10867	
 10868	I shook my head and paused in the act of dislodging the shavings which
 10869	had drifted down my neck.
 10870	
 10871	“Can we make it work?  Can we trust our lives to it? is the test.”
 10872	
 10873	“He is a favourite of yours,” I said.
 10874	
 10875	“When I dismantled my old Pantheon and cast out Napoleon and Cæsar and
 10876	their fellows, I straightway erected a new Pantheon,” she answered
 10877	gravely, “and the first I installed as Dr. Jordan.”
 10878	
 10879	“A modern hero.”
 10880	
 10881	“And a greater because modern,” she added.  “How can the Old World heroes
 10882	compare with ours?”
 10883	
 10884	I shook my head.  We were too much alike in many things for argument.
 10885	Our points of view and outlook on life at least were very alike.
 10886	
 10887	“For a pair of critics we agree famously,” I laughed.
 10888	
 10889	“And as shipwright and able assistant,” she laughed back.
 10890	
 10891	But there was little time for laughter in those days, what of our heavy
 10892	work and of the awfulness of Wolf Larsen’s living death.
 10893	
 10894	He had received another stroke.  He had lost his voice, or he was losing
 10895	it.  He had only intermittent use of it.  As he phrased it, the wires
 10896	were like the stock market, now up, now down.  Occasionally the wires
 10897	were up and he spoke as well as ever, though slowly and heavily.  Then
 10898	speech would suddenly desert him, in the middle of a sentence perhaps,
 10899	and for hours, sometimes, we would wait for the connection to be
 10900	re-established.  He complained of great pain in his head, and it was
 10901	during this period that he arranged a system of communication against the
 10902	time when speech should leave him altogether—one pressure of the hand for
 10903	“yes,” two for “no.”  It was well that it was arranged, for by evening
 10904	his voice had gone from him.  By hand pressures, after that, he answered
 10905	our questions, and when he wished to speak he scrawled his thoughts with
 10906	his left hand, quite legibly, on a sheet of paper.
 10907	
 10908	The fierce winter had now descended upon us.  Gale followed gale, with
 10909	snow and sleet and rain.  The seals had started on their great southern
 10910	migration, and the rookery was practically deserted.  I worked
 10911	feverishly.  In spite of the bad weather, and of the wind which
 10912	especially hindered me, I was on deck from daylight till dark and making
 10913	substantial progress.
 10914	
 10915	I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then
 10916	climbing them to attach the guys.  To the top of the foremast, which was
 10917	just lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, stays and
 10918	throat and peak halyards.  As usual, I had underrated the amount of work
 10919	involved in this portion of the task, and two long days were necessary to
 10920	complete it.  And there was so much yet to be done—the sails, for
 10921	instance, which practically had to be made over.
 10922	
 10923	While I toiled at rigging the foremast, Maud sewed on canvas, ready
 10924	always to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than
 10925	two were required.  The canvas was heavy and hard, and she sewed with the
 10926	regular sailor’s palm and three-cornered sail-needle.  Her hands were
 10927	soon sadly blistered, but she struggled bravely on, and in addition doing
 10928	the cooking and taking care of the sick man.
 10929	
 10930	“A fig for superstition,” I said on Friday morning.  “That mast goes in
 10931	to-day.”
 10932	
 10933	Everything was ready for the attempt.  Carrying the boom-tackle to the
 10934	windlass, I hoisted the mast nearly clear of the deck.  Making this
 10935	tackle fast, I took to the windlass the shears-tackle (which was
 10936	connected with the end of the boom), and with a few turns had the mast
 10937	perpendicular and clear.
 10938	
 10939	Maud clapped her hands the instant she was relieved from holding the
 10940	turn, crying:
 10941	
 10942	“It works!  It works!  We’ll trust our lives to it!”
 10943	
 10944	Then she assumed a rueful expression.
 10945	
 10946	“It’s not over the hole,” she add.  “Will you have to begin all over?”
 10947	
 10948	I smiled in superior fashion, and, slacking off on one of the boom-guys
 10949	and taking in on the other, swung the mast perfectly in the centre of the
 10950	deck.  Still it was not over the hole.  Again the rueful expression came
 10951	on her face, and again I smiled in a superior way.  Slacking away on the
 10952	boom-tackle and hoisting an equivalent amount on the shears-tackle, I
 10953	brought the butt of the mast into position directly over the hole in the
 10954	deck.  Then I gave Maud careful instructions for lowering away and went
 10955	into the hold to the step on the schooner’s bottom.
 10956	
 10957	I called to her, and the mast moved easily and accurately.  Straight
 10958	toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended; but as it
 10959	descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square.
 10960	But I had not even a moment’s indecision.  Calling to Maud to cease
 10961	lowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with
 10962	a rolling hitch.  I left Maud to pull on it while I went below.  By the
 10963	light of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides
 10964	coincided with the sides of the step.  Maud made fast and returned to the
 10965	windlass.  Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches, at
 10966	the same time slightly twisting again.  Again Maud rectified the twist
 10967	with the watch-tackle, and again she lowered away from the windlass.
 10968	Square fitted into square.  The mast was stepped.
 10969	
 10970	I raised a shout, and she ran down to see.  In the yellow lantern light
 10971	we peered at what we had accomplished.  We looked at each other, and our
 10972	hands felt their way and clasped.  The eyes of both of us, I think, were
 10973	moist with the joy of success.
 10974	
 10975	“It was done so easily after all,” I remarked.  “All the work was in the
 10976	preparation.”
 10977	
 10978	“And all the wonder in the completion,” Maud added.  “I can scarcely
 10979	bring myself to realize that that great mast is really up and in; that
 10980	you have lifted it from the water, swung it through the air, and
 10981	deposited it here where it belongs.  It is a Titan’s task.”
 10982	
 10983	“And they made themselves many inventions,” I began merrily, then paused
 10984	to sniff the air.
 10985	
 10986	I looked hastily at the lantern.  It was not smoking.  Again I sniffed.
 10987	
 10988	“Something is burning,” Maud said, with sudden conviction.
 10989	
 10990	We sprang together for the ladder, but I raced past her to the deck.  A
 10991	dense volume of smoke was pouring out of the steerage companion-way.
 10992	
 10993	“The Wolf is not yet dead,” I muttered to myself as I sprang down through
 10994	the smoke.
 10995	
 10996	It was so thick in the confined space that I was compelled to feel my
 10997	way; and so potent was the spell of Wolf Larsen on my imagination, I was
 10998	quite prepared for the helpless giant to grip my neck in a strangle hold.
 10999	I hesitated, the desire to race back and up the steps to the deck almost
 11000	overpowering me.  Then I recollected Maud.  The vision of her, as I had
 11001	last seen her, in the lantern light of the schooner’s hold, her brown
 11002	eyes warm and moist with joy, flashed before me, and I knew that I could
 11003	not go back.
 11004	
 11005	I was choking and suffocating by the time I reached Wolf Larsen’s bunk.
 11006	I reached my hand and felt for his.  He was lying motionless, but moved
 11007	slightly at the touch of my hand.  I felt over and under his blankets.
 11008	There was no warmth, no sign of fire.  Yet that smoke which blinded me
 11009	and made me cough and gasp must have a source.  I lost my head
 11010	temporarily and dashed frantically about the steerage.  A collision with
 11011	the table partially knocked the wind from my body and brought me to
 11012	myself.  I reasoned that a helpless man could start a fire only near to
 11013	where he lay.
 11014	
 11015	I returned to Wolf Larsen’s bunk.  There I encountered Maud.  How long
 11016	she had been there in that suffocating atmosphere I could not guess.
 11017	
 11018	“Go up on deck!” I commanded peremptorily.
 11019	
 11020	“But, Humphrey—” she began to protest in a queer, husky voice.
 11021	
 11022	“Please! please!” I shouted at her harshly.
 11023	
 11024	She drew away obediently, and then I thought, What if she cannot find the
 11025	steps?  I started after her, to stop at the foot of the companion-way.
 11026	Perhaps she had gone up.  As I stood there, hesitant, I heard her cry
 11027	softly:
 11028	
 11029	“Oh, Humphrey, I am lost.”
 11030	
 11031	I found her fumbling at the wall of the after bulkhead, and, half leading
 11032	her, half carrying her, I took her up the companion-way.  The pure air
 11033	was like nectar.  Maud was only faint and dizzy, and I left her lying on
 11034	the deck when I took my second plunge below.
 11035	
 11036	The source of the smoke must be very close to Wolf Larsen—my mind was
 11037	made up to this, and I went straight to his bunk.  As I felt about among
 11038	his blankets, something hot fell on the back of my hand.  It burned me,
 11039	and I jerked my hand away.  Then I understood.  Through the cracks in the
 11040	bottom of the upper bunk he had set fire to the mattress.  He still
 11041	retained sufficient use of his left arm to do this.  The damp straw of
 11042	the mattress, fired from beneath and denied air, had been smouldering all
 11043	the while.
 11044	
 11045	As I dragged the mattress out of the bunk it seemed to disintegrate in
 11046	mid-air, at the same time bursting into flames.  I beat out the burning
 11047	remnants of straw in the bunk, then made a dash for the deck for fresh
 11048	air.
 11049	
 11050	Several buckets of water sufficed to put out the burning mattress in the
 11051	middle of the steerage floor; and ten minutes later, when the smoke had
 11052	fairly cleared, I allowed Maud to come below.  Wolf Larsen was
 11053	unconscious, but it was a matter of minutes for the fresh air to restore
 11054	him.  We were working over him, however, when he signed for paper and
 11055	pencil.
 11056	
 11057	“Pray do not interrupt me,” he wrote.  “I am smiling.”
 11058	
 11059	“I am still a bit of the ferment, you see,” he wrote a little later.
 11060	
 11061	“I am glad you are as small a bit as you are,” I said.
 11062	
 11063	“Thank you,” he wrote.  “But just think of how much smaller I shall be
 11064	before I die.”
 11065	
 11066	“And yet I am all here, Hump,” he wrote with a final flourish.  “I can
 11067	think more clearly than ever in my life before.  Nothing to disturb me.
 11068	Concentration is perfect.  I am all here and more than here.”
 11069	
 11070	It was like a message from the night of the grave; for this man’s body
 11071	had become his mausoleum.  And there, in so strange sepulchre, his spirit
 11072	fluttered and lived.  It would flutter and live till the last line of
 11073	communication was broken, and after that who was to say how much longer
 11074	it might continue to flutter and live?
 11075	
 11076	
 11077	
 11078	
 11079	CHAPTER XXXVIII
 11080	
 11081	
 11082	“I think my left side is going,” Wolf Larsen wrote, the morning after his
 11083	attempt to fire the ship.  “The numbness is growing.  I can hardly move
 11084	my hand.  You will have to speak louder.  The last lines are going down.”
 11085	
 11086	“Are you in pain?” I asked.
 11087	
 11088	I was compelled to repeat my question loudly before he answered:
 11089	
 11090	“Not all the time.”
 11091	
 11092	The left hand stumbled slowly and painfully across the paper, and it was
 11093	with extreme difficulty that we deciphered the scrawl.  It was like a
 11094	“spirit message,” such as are delivered at séances of spiritualists for a
 11095	dollar admission.
 11096	
 11097	“But I am still here, all here,” the hand scrawled more slowly and
 11098	painfully than ever.
 11099	
 11100	The pencil dropped, and we had to replace it in the hand.
 11101	
 11102	“When there is no pain I have perfect peace and quiet.  I have never
 11103	thought so clearly.  I can ponder life and death like a Hindoo sage.”
 11104	
 11105	“And immortality?” Maud queried loudly in the ear.
 11106	
 11107	Three times the hand essayed to write but fumbled hopelessly.  The pencil
 11108	fell.  In vain we tried to replace it.  The fingers could not close on
 11109	it.  Then Maud pressed and held the fingers about the pencil with her own
 11110	hand and the hand wrote, in large letters, and so slowly that the minutes
 11111	ticked off to each letter:
 11112	
 11113	“B-O-S-H.”
 11114	
 11115	It was Wolf Larsen’s last word, “bosh,” sceptical and invincible to the
 11116	end.  The arm and hand relaxed.  The trunk of the body moved slightly.
 11117	Then there was no movement.  Maud released the hand.  The fingers spread
 11118	slightly, falling apart of their own weight, and the pencil rolled away.
 11119	
 11120	“Do you still hear?” I shouted, holding the fingers and waiting for the
 11121	single pressure which would signify “Yes.”  There was no response.  The
 11122	hand was dead.
 11123	
 11124	“I noticed the lips slightly move,” Maud said.
 11125	
 11126	I repeated the question.  The lips moved.  She placed the tips of her
 11127	fingers on them.  Again I repeated the question.  “Yes,” Maud announced.
 11128	We looked at each other expectantly.
 11129	
 11130	“What good is it?” I asked.  “What can we say now?”
 11131	
 11132	“Oh, ask him—”
 11133	
 11134	She hesitated.
 11135	
 11136	“Ask him something that requires no for an answer,” I suggested.  “Then
 11137	we will know for certainty.”
 11138	
 11139	“Are you hungry?” she cried.
 11140	
 11141	The lips moved under her fingers, and she answered, “Yes.”
 11142	
 11143	“Will you have some beef?” was her next query.
 11144	
 11145	“No,” she announced.
 11146	
 11147	“Beef-tea?”
 11148	
 11149	“Yes, he will have some beef-tea,” she said, quietly, looking up at me.
 11150	“Until his hearing goes we shall be able to communicate with him.  And
 11151	after that—”
 11152	
 11153	She looked at me queerly.  I saw her lips trembling and the tears
 11154	swimming up in her eyes.  She swayed toward me and I caught her in my
 11155	arms.
 11156	
 11157	“Oh, Humphrey,” she sobbed, “when will it all end?  I am so tired, so
 11158	tired.”
 11159	
 11160	She buried her head on my shoulder, her frail form shaken with a storm of
 11161	weeping.  She was like a feather in my arms, so slender, so ethereal.
 11162	“She has broken down at last,” I thought.  “What can I do without her
 11163	help?”
 11164	
 11165	But I soothed and comforted her, till she pulled herself bravely together
 11166	and recuperated mentally as quickly as she was wont to do physically.
 11167	
 11168	“I ought to be ashamed of myself,” she said.  Then added, with the
 11169	whimsical smile I adored, “but I am only one, small woman.”
 11170	
 11171	That phrase, the “one small woman,” startled me like an electric shock.
 11172	It was my own phrase, my pet, secret phrase, my love phrase for her.
 11173	
 11174	“Where did you get that phrase?” I demanded, with an abruptness that in
 11175	turn startled her.
 11176	
 11177	“What phrase?” she asked.
 11178	
 11179	“One small woman.”
 11180	
 11181	“Is it yours?” she asked.
 11182	
 11183	“Yes,” I answered.  “Mine.  I made it.”
 11184	
 11185	“Then you must have talked in your sleep,” she smiled.
 11186	
 11187	The dancing, tremulous light was in her eyes.  Mine, I knew, were
 11188	speaking beyond the will of my speech.  I leaned toward her.  Without
 11189	volition I leaned toward her, as a tree is swayed by the wind.  Ah, we
 11190	were very close together in that moment.  But she shook her head, as one
 11191	might shake off sleep or a dream, saying:
 11192	
 11193	“I have known it all my life.  It was my father’s name for my mother.”
 11194	
 11195	“It is my phrase too,” I said stubbornly.
 11196	
 11197	“For your mother?”
 11198	
 11199	“No,” I answered, and she questioned no further, though I could have
 11200	sworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking, teasing expression.
 11201	
 11202	With the foremast in, the work now went on apace.  Almost before I knew
 11203	it, and without one serious hitch, I had the mainmast stepped.  A
 11204	derrick-boom, rigged to the foremast, had accomplished this; and several
 11205	days more found all stays and shrouds in place, and everything set up
 11206	taut.  Topsails would be a nuisance and a danger for a crew of two, so I
 11207	heaved the topmasts on deck and lashed them fast.
 11208	
 11209	Several more days were consumed in finishing the sails and putting them
 11210	on.  There were only three—the jib, foresail, and mainsail; and, patched,
 11211	shortened, and distorted, they were a ridiculously ill-fitting suit for
 11212	so trim a craft as the _Ghost_.
 11213	
 11214	“But they’ll work!” Maud cried jubilantly.  “We’ll make them work, and
 11215	trust our lives to them!”
 11216	
 11217	Certainly, among my many new trades, I shone least as a sail-maker.  I
 11218	could sail them better than make them, and I had no doubt of my power to
 11219	bring the schooner to some northern port of Japan.  In fact, I had
 11220	crammed navigation from text-books aboard; and besides, there was Wolf
 11221	Larsen’s star-scale, so simple a device that a child could work it.
 11222	
 11223	As for its inventor, beyond an increasing deafness and the movement of
 11224	the lips growing fainter and fainter, there had been little change in his
 11225	condition for a week.  But on the day we finished bending the schooner’s
 11226	sails, he heard his last, and the last movement of his lips died away—but
 11227	not before I had asked him, “Are you all there?” and the lips had
 11228	answered, “Yes.”
 11229	
 11230	The last line was down.  Somewhere within that tomb of the flesh still
 11231	dwelt the soul of the man.  Walled by the living clay, that fierce
 11232	intelligence we had known burned on; but it burned on in silence and
 11233	darkness.  And it was disembodied.  To that intelligence there could be
 11234	no objective knowledge of a body.  It knew no body.  The very world was
 11235	not.  It knew only itself and the vastness and profundity of the quiet
 11236	and the dark.
 11237	
 11238	
 11239	
 11240	
 11241	CHAPTER XXXIX
 11242	
 11243	
 11244	The day came for our departure.  There was no longer anything to detain
 11245	us on Endeavour Island.  The _Ghost’s_ stumpy masts were in place, her
 11246	crazy sails bent.  All my handiwork was strong, none of it beautiful; but
 11247	I knew that it would work, and I felt myself a man of power as I looked
 11248	at it.
 11249	
 11250	“I did it!  I did it!  With my own hands I did it!” I wanted to cry
 11251	aloud.
 11252	
 11253	But Maud and I had a way of voicing each other’s thoughts, and she said,
 11254	as we prepared to hoist the mainsail:
 11255	
 11256	“To think, Humphrey, you did it all with your own hands?”
 11257	
 11258	“But there were two other hands,” I answered.  “Two small hands, and
 11259	don’t say that was a phrase, also, of your father.”
 11260	
 11261	She laughed and shook her head, and held her hands up for inspection.
 11262	
 11263	“I can never get them clean again,” she wailed, “nor soften the
 11264	weather-beat.”
 11265	
 11266	“Then dirt and weather-beat shall be your guerdon of honour,” I said,
 11267	holding them in mine; and, spite of my resolutions, I would have kissed
 11268	the two dear hands had she not swiftly withdrawn them.
 11269	
 11270	Our comradeship was becoming tremulous, I had mastered my love long and
 11271	well, but now it was mastering me.  Wilfully had it disobeyed and won my
 11272	eyes to speech, and now it was winning my tongue—ay, and my lips, for
 11273	they were mad this moment to kiss the two small hands which had toiled so
 11274	faithfully and hard.  And I, too, was mad.  There was a cry in my being
 11275	like bugles calling me to her.  And there was a wind blowing upon me
 11276	which I could not resist, swaying the very body of me till I leaned
 11277	toward her, all unconscious that I leaned.  And she knew it.  She could
 11278	not but know it as she swiftly drew away her hands, and yet, could not
 11279	forbear one quick searching look before she turned away her eyes.
 11280	
 11281	By means of deck-tackles I had arranged to carry the halyards forward to
 11282	the windlass; and now I hoisted the mainsail, peak and throat, at the
 11283	same time.  It was a clumsy way, but it did not take long, and soon the
 11284	foresail as well was up and fluttering.
 11285	
 11286	“We can never get that anchor up in this narrow place, once it has left
 11287	the bottom,” I said.  “We should be on the rocks first.”
 11288	
 11289	“What can you do?” she asked.
 11290	
 11291	“Slip it,” was my answer.  “And when I do, you must do your first work on
 11292	the windlass.  I shall have to run at once to the wheel, and at the same
 11293	time you must be hoisting the jib.”
 11294	
 11295	This manœuvre of getting under way I had studied and worked out a score
 11296	of times; and, with the jib-halyard to the windlass, I knew Maud was
 11297	capable of hoisting that most necessary sail.  A brisk wind was blowing
 11298	into the cove, and though the water was calm, rapid work was required to
 11299	get us safely out.
 11300	
 11301	When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared out through the
 11302	hawse-hole and into the sea.  I raced aft, putting the wheel up.  The
 11303	_Ghost_ seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her
 11304	sails.  The jib was rising.  As it filled, the _Ghost’s_ bow swung off
 11305	and I had to put the wheel down a few spokes and steady her.
 11306	
 11307	I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of
 11308	itself, so there was no need for Maud to attend to that; but she was
 11309	still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down.  It was a moment
 11310	of anxiety, for the _Ghost_ was rushing directly upon the beach, a
 11311	stone’s throw distant.  But she swung obediently on her heel into the
 11312	wind.  There was a great fluttering and flapping of canvas and
 11313	reef-points, most welcome to my ears, then she filled away on the other
 11314	tack.
 11315	
 11316	Maud had finished her task and come aft, where she stood beside me, a
 11317	small cap perched on her wind-blown hair, her cheeks flushed from
 11318	exertion, her eyes wide and bright with the excitement, her nostrils
 11319	quivering to the rush and bite of the fresh salt air.  Her brown eyes
 11320	were like a startled deer’s.  There was a wild, keen look in them I had
 11321	never seen before, and her lips parted and her breath suspended as the
 11322	_Ghost_, charging upon the wall of rock at the entrance to the inner
 11323	cove, swept into the wind and filled away into safe water.
 11324	
 11325	My first mate’s berth on the sealing grounds stood me in good stead, and
 11326	I cleared the inner cove and laid a long tack along the shore of the
 11327	outer cove.  Once again about, and the _Ghost_ headed out to open sea.
 11328	She had now caught the bosom-breathing of the ocean, and was herself
 11329	a-breath with the rhythm of it as she smoothly mounted and slipped down
 11330	each broad-backed wave.  The day had been dull and overcast, but the sun
 11331	now burst through the clouds, a welcome omen, and shone upon the curving
 11332	beach where together we had dared the lords of the harem and slain the
 11333	holluschickie.  All Endeavour Island brightened under the sun.  Even the
 11334	grim south-western promontory showed less grim, and here and there, where
 11335	the sea-spray wet its surface, high lights flashed and dazzled in the
 11336	sun.
 11337	
 11338	“I shall always think of it with pride,” I said to Maud.
 11339	
 11340	She threw her head back in a queenly way but said, “Dear, dear Endeavour
 11341	Island!  I shall always love it.”
 11342	
 11343	“And I,” I said quickly.
 11344	
 11345	It seemed our eyes must meet in a great understanding, and yet, loath,
 11346	they struggled away and did not meet.
 11347	
 11348	There was a silence I might almost call awkward, till I broke it, saying:
 11349	
 11350	“See those black clouds to windward.  You remember, I told you last night
 11351	the barometer was falling.”
 11352	
 11353	“And the sun is gone,” she said, her eyes still fixed upon our island,
 11354	where we had proved our mastery over matter and attained to the truest
 11355	comradeship that may fall to man and woman.
 11356	
 11357	“And it’s slack off the sheets for Japan!” I cried gaily.  “A fair wind
 11358	and a flowing sheet, you know, or however it goes.”
 11359	
 11360	Lashing the wheel I ran forward, eased the fore and mainsheets, took in
 11361	on the boom-tackles and trimmed everything for the quartering breeze
 11362	which was ours.  It was a fresh breeze, very fresh, but I resolved to run
 11363	as long as I dared.  Unfortunately, when running free, it is impossible
 11364	to lash the wheel, so I faced an all-night watch.  Maud insisted on
 11365	relieving me, but proved that she had not the strength to steer in a
 11366	heavy sea, even if she could have gained the wisdom on such short notice.
 11367	She appeared quite heart-broken over the discovery, but recovered her
 11368	spirits by coiling down tackles and halyards and all stray ropes.  Then
 11369	there were meals to be cooked in the galley, beds to make, Wolf Larsen to
 11370	be attended upon, and she finished the day with a grand house-cleaning
 11371	attack upon the cabin and steerage.
 11372	
 11373	All night I steered, without relief, the wind slowly and steadily
 11374	increasing and the sea rising.  At five in the morning Maud brought me
 11375	hot coffee and biscuits she had baked, and at seven a substantial and
 11376	piping hot breakfast put new lift into me.
 11377	
 11378	Throughout the day, and as slowly and steadily as ever, the wind
 11379	increased.  It impressed one with its sullen determination to blow, and
 11380	blow harder, and keep on blowing.  And still the _Ghost_ foamed along,
 11381	racing off the miles till I was certain she was making at least eleven
 11382	knots.  It was too good to lose, but by nightfall I was exhausted.
 11383	Though in splendid physical trim, a thirty-six-hour trick at the wheel
 11384	was the limit of my endurance.  Besides, Maud begged me to heave to, and
 11385	I knew, if the wind and sea increased at the same rate during the night,
 11386	that it would soon be impossible to heave to.  So, as twilight deepened,
 11387	gladly and at the same time reluctantly, I brought the _Ghost_ up on the
 11388	wind.
 11389	
 11390	But I had not reckoned upon the colossal task the reefing of three sails
 11391	meant for one man.  While running away from the wind I had not
 11392	appreciated its force, but when we ceased to run I learned to my sorrow,
 11393	and well-nigh to my despair, how fiercely it was really blowing.  The
 11394	wind balked my every effort, ripping the canvas out of my hands and in an
 11395	instant undoing what I had gained by ten minutes of severest struggle.
 11396	At eight o’clock I had succeeded only in putting the second reef into the
 11397	foresail.  At eleven o’clock I was no farther along.  Blood dripped from
 11398	every finger-end, while the nails were broken to the quick.  From pain
 11399	and sheer exhaustion I wept in the darkness, secretly, so that Maud
 11400	should not know.
 11401	
 11402	Then, in desperation, I abandoned the attempt to reef the mainsail and
 11403	resolved to try the experiment of heaving to under the close-reefed
 11404	foresail.  Three hours more were required to gasket the mainsail and jib,
 11405	and at two in the morning, nearly dead, the life almost buffeted and
 11406	worked out of me, I had barely sufficient consciousness to know the
 11407	experiment was a success.  The close-reefed foresail worked.  The _Ghost_
 11408	clung on close to the wind and betrayed no inclination to fall off
 11409	broadside to the trough.
 11410	
 11411	I was famished, but Maud tried vainly to get me to eat.  I dozed with my
 11412	mouth full of food.  I would fall asleep in the act of carrying food to
 11413	my mouth and waken in torment to find the act yet uncompleted.  So
 11414	sleepily helpless was I that she was compelled to hold me in my chair to
 11415	prevent my being flung to the floor by the violent pitching of the
 11416	schooner.
 11417	
 11418	Of the passage from the galley to the cabin I knew nothing.  It was a
 11419	sleep-walker Maud guided and supported.  In fact, I was aware of nothing
 11420	till I awoke, how long after I could not imagine, in my bunk with my
 11421	boots off.  It was dark.  I was stiff and lame, and cried out with pain
 11422	when the bed-clothes touched my poor finger-ends.
 11423	
 11424	Morning had evidently not come, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep
 11425	again.  I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and it was
 11426	night again.
 11427	
 11428	Once more I woke, troubled because I could sleep no better.  I struck a
 11429	match and looked at my watch.  It marked midnight.  And I had not left
 11430	the deck until three!  I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the
 11431	solution.  No wonder I was sleeping brokenly.  I had slept twenty-one
 11432	hours.  I listened for a while to the behaviour of the _Ghost_, to the
 11433	pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck, and then
 11434	turned over on my side and slept peacefully until morning.
 11435	
 11436	When I arose at seven I saw no sign of Maud and concluded she was in the
 11437	galley preparing breakfast.  On deck I found the _Ghost_ doing splendidly
 11438	under her patch of canvas.  But in the galley, though a fire was burning
 11439	and water boiling, I found no Maud.
 11440	
 11441	I discovered her in the steerage, by Wolf Larsen’s bunk.  I looked at
 11442	him, the man who had been hurled down from the topmost pitch of life to
 11443	be buried alive and be worse than dead.  There seemed a relaxation of his
 11444	expressionless face which was new.  Maud looked at me and I understood.
 11445	
 11446	“His life flickered out in the storm,” I said.
 11447	
 11448	“But he still lives,” she answered, infinite faith in her voice.
 11449	
 11450	“He had too great strength.”
 11451	
 11452	“Yes,” she said, “but now it no longer shackles him.  He is a free
 11453	spirit.”
 11454	
 11455	“He is a free spirit surely,” I answered; and, taking her hand, I led her
 11456	on deck.
 11457	
 11458	The storm broke that night, which is to say that it diminished as slowly
 11459	as it had arisen.  After breakfast next morning, when I had hoisted Wolf
 11460	Larsen’s body on deck ready for burial, it was still blowing heavily and
 11461	a large sea was running.  The deck was continually awash with the sea
 11462	which came inboard over the rail and through the scuppers.  The wind
 11463	smote the schooner with a sudden gust, and she heeled over till her lee
 11464	rail was buried, the roar in her rigging rising in pitch to a shriek.  We
 11465	stood in the water to our knees as I bared my head.
 11466	
 11467	“I remember only one part of the service,” I said, “and that is, ‘And the
 11468	body shall be cast into the sea.’”
 11469	
 11470	Maud looked at me, surprised and shocked; but the spirit of something I
 11471	had seen before was strong upon me, impelling me to give service to Wolf
 11472	Larsen as Wolf Larsen had once given service to another man.  I lifted
 11473	the end of the hatch cover and the canvas-shrouded body slipped feet
 11474	first into the sea.  The weight of iron dragged it down.  It was gone.
 11475	
 11476	“Good-bye, Lucifer, proud spirit,” Maud whispered, so low that it was
 11477	drowned by the shouting of the wind; but I saw the movement of her lips
 11478	and knew.
 11479	
 11480	As we clung to the lee rail and worked our way aft, I happened to glance
 11481	to leeward.  The _Ghost_, at the moment, was uptossed on a sea, and I
 11482	caught a clear view of a small steamship two or three miles away, rolling
 11483	and pitching, head on to the sea, as it steamed toward us.  It was
 11484	painted black, and from the talk of the hunters of their poaching
 11485	exploits I recognized it as a United States revenue cutter.  I pointed it
 11486	out to Maud and hurriedly led her aft to the safety of the poop.
 11487	
 11488	I started to rush below to the flag-locker, then remembered that in
 11489	rigging the _Ghost_.  I had forgotten to make provision for a
 11490	flag-halyard.
 11491	
 11492	“We need no distress signal,” Maud said.  “They have only to see us.”
 11493	
 11494	“We are saved,” I said, soberly and solemnly.  And then, in an exuberance
 11495	of joy, “I hardly know whether to be glad or not.”
 11496	
 11497	I looked at her.  Our eyes were not loath to meet.  We leaned toward each
 11498	other, and before I knew it my arms were about her.
 11499	
 11500	“Need I?” I asked.
 11501	
 11502	And she answered, “There is no need, though the telling of it would be
 11503	sweet, so sweet.”
 11504	
 11505	Her lips met the press of mine, and, by what strange trick of the
 11506	imagination I know not, the scene in the cabin of the _Ghost_ flashed
 11507	upon me, when she had pressed her fingers lightly on my lips and said,
 11508	“Hush, hush.”
 11509	
 11510	“My woman, my one small woman,” I said, my free hand petting her shoulder
 11511	in the way all lovers know though never learn in school.
 11512	
 11513	“My man,” she said, looking at me for an instant with tremulous lids
 11514	which fluttered down and veiled her eyes as she snuggled her head against
 11515	my breast with a happy little sigh.

 11523	smile, whimsical as I had never seen it, for it was whimsical with love.

 11574	THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 11575	PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
 11576	
 11577	To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 11578	distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 11579	(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 11580	Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 11581	Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 11582	http://www.gutenberg.org/license).
 11583	
 11584	
 11585	Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 11586	electronic works
 11587	
 11588	1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 11589	electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 11590	and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 11591	(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 11592	the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 11593	all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 11594	If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 11595	Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 11596	terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 11597	entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
 11598	
 11599	1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 11600	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 11601	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 11602	things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 11603	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 11604	paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 11605	Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 11606	and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 11607	works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
 11608	
 11609	1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 11610	or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 11611	Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 11612	collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 11613	individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 11614	located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 11615	copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 11616	works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 11617	are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 11618	Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 11619	freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 11620	this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 11621	the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 11622	keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 11623	Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
 11624	
 11625	1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 11626	what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 11627	a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 11628	the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 11629	before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 11630	creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 11631	Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 11632	the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 11633	States.
 11634	
 11635	1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
 11636	
 11637	1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 11638	access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 11639	whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 11640	phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 11641	Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 11642	copied or distributed:
 11643	
 11644	This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 11645	almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 11646	re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 11647	with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
 11648	
 11649	1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 11650	from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 11651	posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 11652	and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 11653	or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 11654	with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 11655	work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 11656	through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 11657	Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 11658	1.E.9.
 11659	
 11660	1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 11661	with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 11662	must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 11663	terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 11664	to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 11665	permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
 11666	
 11667	1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 11668	License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 11669	work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
 11670	
 11671	1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 11672	electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 11673	prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 11674	active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 11675	Gutenberg-tm License.
 11676	
 11677	1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 11678	compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 11679	word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 11680	distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 11681	"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 11682	posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
 11683	you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 11684	copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 11685	request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 11686	form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 11687	License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
 11688	
 11689	1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 11690	performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 11691	unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
 11692	
 11693	1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 11694	access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 11695	that
 11696	
 11697	- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 11698	     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
 11699	     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
 11700	     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 11701	     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 11702	     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
 11703	     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 11704	     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 11705	     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 11706	     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 11707	     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 11708	     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
 11709	
 11710	- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 11711	     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 11712	     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 11713	     License.  You must require such a user to return or
 11714	     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 11715	     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 11716	     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 11717	
 11718	- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 11719	     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 11720	     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 11721	     of receipt of the work.
 11722	
 11723	- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 11724	     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 11725	
 11726	1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 11727	electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 11728	forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 11729	both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 11730	Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 11731	Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
 11732	
 11733	1.F.
 11734	
 11735	1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 11736	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 11737	public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 11738	collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 11739	works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 11740	"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 11741	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 11742	property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 11743	computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 11744	your equipment.
 11745	
 11746	1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 11747	of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 11748	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 11749	Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 11750	Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 11751	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 11752	fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 11753	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 11754	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 11755	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 11756	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 11757	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 11758	DAMAGE.
 11759	
 11760	1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 11761	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 11762	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 11763	written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 11764	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 11765	your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 11766	the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 11767	refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 11768	providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 11769	receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 11770	is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 11771	opportunities to fix the problem.
 11772	
 11773	1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 11774	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
 11775	WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 11776	WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
 11777	
 11778	1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 11779	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 11780	If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 11781	law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 11782	interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 11783	the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 11784	provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
 11785	
 11786	1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 11787	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 11788	providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 11789	with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 11790	promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 11791	harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 11792	that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 11793	or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 11794	work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 11795	Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
 11796	
 11797	
 11798	Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 11799	
 11800	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 11801	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 11802	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 11803	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 11804	people in all walks of life.
 11805	
 11806	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 11807	assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 11808	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 11809	remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 11810	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 11811	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 11812	To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 11813	and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 11814	and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

 11816	
 11817	Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
 11818	Foundation
 11819	
 11820	The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
 11821	501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
 11822	state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
 11823	Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
 11824	number is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
 11825	Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
 11826	permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
 11827	
 11828	The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.
 11829	Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered
 11830	throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at
 11831	809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email
 11832	business@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact
 11833	information can be found at the Foundation's web site and official
 11834	page at http://www.gutenberg.org/about/contact

 11841	Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 11842	Literary Archive Foundation
 11843	
 11844	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 11845	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 11846	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 11847	freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 11848	array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 11849	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 11850	status with the IRS.
 11851	
 11852	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 11853	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 11854	States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 11855	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 11856	with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 11857	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 11858	SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 11859	particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate
 11860	
 11861	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 11862	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 11863	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 11864	approach us with offers to donate.
 11865	
 11866	International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 11867	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 11868	outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
 11869	
 11870	Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 11871	methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 11872	ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
 11873	To donate, please visit:

 11877	Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 11878	works.
 11879	
 11880	Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 11881	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 11882	with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 11883	Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 11884	
 11885	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 11886	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 11887	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 11888	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
 11889	
 11890	Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
 11891	
 11892	     http://www.gutenberg.org
 11893	
 11894	This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 11895	including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 11896	Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 11897	subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
